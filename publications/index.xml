      <description>Consider counting on your fingers; or solving a challenging mathematical problem using pen and paper (or Napier’s bones, or a slide-rule); or the way in which we routinely offload the psychological task of remembering phone numbers on to our ubiquitous mobile phones; or a brainstorming scenario in which new creative ideas emerge from a process of collective group interaction; or the manner in which the intelligent feat of ship navigation is realised through a pattern of embodied, information-communicating social exchanges between crew members who, individually, perform purely local information-processing tasks (such as bearing taking) using specialised technology.</description>

      <title>Distributed Cognition in Classical Antiquity</title>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/distributed-cognition-in-classical-antiquity/</guid>
      <description>An opening essay outlining the theoretical framework along with twelve essays by international specialists in classical antiquity create a period-specific interdisciplinary introduction to distributed cognition and the cognitive humanities. This collection explores how cognition is explicitly or implicitly conceived of as distributed across brain, body and world in Greek and Roman technology, science, medicine, material culture, philosophy, and literary studies.
A range of models emerge, which vary both in terms of whether cognition is just embodied or involves tools or objects in the world.</description>

      <title>Triviality arguments about computational implementation</title>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/triviality-arguments-about-computational-implementation/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction Triviality arguments seek to show that computational implementation in physical systems is trivial in some worrisome way. A triviality argument might show that a theory of implementation attributes computations to too many physical systems, or that it attributes too many computations to those physical systems that compute, or both. Triviality arguments threaten to make trouble both for computational functionalism (the metaphysical claim that implementing a certain computation is sufficient for having a certain mental state or process) and for computational explanation in science (the scientific practice of explaining mental and behavioral phenomena in terms of physical computations).</description>

      <description>Computational approaches to explain how the mind works have bloomed in the last three decades. The idea that computing can explain thinking emerged in the early modern period, but its impact on the philosophy and sciences of mind and brain owes much to the groundbreaking work of Alan Turing on both the foundations of mathematical computation theory and artificial intelligence (e.g. Turing 1936, 1950). Turing’s work set the stage for the computational theory of mind (CTM), which, classically understood, claims that thinking is a computational process over linguistically structured representations.</description>

      <title>Review of *The Language of Thought: A New Philosophical Direction* by Susan Schneider</title>

      <description>1 Introduction The Language of Thought (LOT) is closely associated with the work of Jerry Fodor. Fodor defended the idea in his book, The Language of Thought (1975), and he continued to do so, with relatively minor revisions, throughout his career. Susan Schneider’s book does not aim to be an exegesis or defence of Fodor. Instead, it offers an alternative to Fodor’s version of LOT that she says is an improvement and a worthy replacement.</description>

      <description>Computational approaches dominate contemporary cognitive science, promising a unified, scientific explanation of how the mind works. However, computational approaches raise major philosophical and scientific questions. In what sense is the mind computational? How do computational approaches explain perception, learning, and decision making? What kinds of challenges should computational approaches overcome to advance our understanding of mind, brain, and behaviour?
The Routledge Handbook of the Computational Mind is an outstanding overview and exploration of these issues and the first philosophical collection of its kind.</description>

      <title>Eliminativism about consciousness</title>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/eliminativism-about-consciousness/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction In this chapter, we examine a radical philosophical position about consciousness: eliminativism. Eliminativists claim that consciousness does not exist and/or that talk of consciousness should be eliminated from serious science. These are strong positions to take, and require serious defence. To evaluate these positions, the chapter is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the difference between entity eliminativism and discourse eliminativism and outline the typical strategies used to support each.</description>

      <title>Realism about cognitive science</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/realism-about-cognitive-science-2018/</link>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/realism-about-cognitive-science-2018/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction This chapter is about a puzzle. Realism about \(X\) is often glossed as the claim that \(X\)s are mind independent: \(X\)s exist and have their nature independent of human beliefs, interests, attitudes, and other mental states. \(X\)s are out there, getting on with it, independently of human minds. How then should one understand realism about the mind? Having an answer to this is important if one wants to be a realist about cognitive science.</description>

      <title>Philosophy of the psychological and cognitive sciences</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/philosophy-of-the-psychological-and-cognitive-sciences-2016/</link>

      <description>1 Introduction Philosophy of the psychological and cognitive sciences is a broad and heterogeneous domain. The psychological and cognitive sciences are rapidly evolving, fragmented, and often lacking in theories that are as precise as one might like. Consequently, philosophers of science have a challenging subject matter: fast moving, variegated, and sometimes slightly fuzzy. Nevertheless, the psychological and cognitive sciences are fertile ground for philosophers. Philosophers can bring their skills to bear with productive effect: in interpreting scientific theories, precisifying concepts, exploring relations of explanatory and logical coherence between theories, and in typing psychological states, processes, and capacities.</description>

      <title>Turing&#39;s model of the mind</title>

      <description>Alan Turing contributed to a revolutionary idea: that mental activity is computation. Turing’s work helped lay the foundation for what is now known as cognitive science. Today, computation is an essential element for explaining how the mind works. In this chapter, I return to Turing’s early attempts to understanding the mind using computation and examine the role that Turing played in the early days of cognitive science.
1 Engineering versus psychology Turing is famous as a founding figure in artificial intelligence (AI) but his contribution to cognitive science is less well known.</description>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/from-intelligent-machines-to-the-human-brain-2015/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction This chapter introduces the idea that computation is a key tool that can help us understand how the human brain works. Recent years have seen a revolution in the kinds of tasks computers can perform. Underlying these advances is the burgeoning field of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, which aims at creating machines that can act without being programmed, learning from data and experience. Rather startlingly, it turns out that the same methods that allow us to make intelligent machines also appear to hold the key to explaining how our brains work.</description>

      <description>1 The question of consciousness: Philosophical perspectives Human consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries in the universe. From one point of view this should be surprising, since we know a great deal about consciousness from our own experience. One could say that our own conscious experience is the thing in the world that we know best. Descartes wanted to build the entirety of natural science on the foundation of our understanding of our conscious thought.</description>

      <description>Alan Turing has long proved a subject of fascination, but following the centenary of his birth in 2012, the code-breaker, computer pioneer, mathematician (and much more) has become even more celebrated with much media coverage, and several meetings, conferences and books raising public awareness of Turing’s life and work.
This volume brings together contributions from some of the leading experts on Alan Turing to create a comprehensive guide to Turing that will serve as a useful resource for researchers in the area as well as the increasingly interested general reader.</description>

      <title>Group minds and explanatory simplicity</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction In three papers, Robert Rupert presents arguments against group minds (Rupert 2005, 2011, 2014) These criticisms motivate the conclusion that although the discovery of group minds is an open empirical possibility, there are strong reasons for thinking that no group minds exist. One of Rupert’s principal arguments against group minds is an argument from explanatory simplicity. His claim is that, for any explanation of intelligent behaviour that appeals to group minds, there exists an alternative explanation couched solely in terms of the minds of individuals.</description>

      <description>This volume gives promising younger researchers in the philosophy of mind a chance to stir up new ideas. They have been asked to think afresh, to consider what the new waves might look like. The contributors offer what they take to be the right philosophical account of the topic in question, examining along the way where they think the philosophy of mind and cognition is and ought to be going.</description>

      <title>Review of *The Evolved Apprentice* by Kim Sterelny</title>

      <description>What makes humans unique? There are many ways in which humans differ from other primates: being bipedal, dependence on technology, social organisation, geographical range, lifespan. In The Evolved Apprentice, Sterelny takes one human novelty as central to explaining why humans are different: our power to transmit vast amounts of information across generations. Chimps and gorillas resemble their parents largely as a result of genetic inheritance. Social learning gives humans a powerful alternative for high-bandwidth, high-fidelity information transmission.</description>

      <description>The debate between internalists and externalists is multifaceted, straddling vexed issues in contemporary philosophy. This chapter focuses on the distinction between content and vehicle as it pertains to the internalism/externalism debate in philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Whereas content internalism/externalism seeks to give an account of what makes mental states have the contents they have rather than some other contents or no contents at all, vehicle internalism/externalism seeks to give an account of the processes or mechanisms that enable mental states with contents to play a causal role in, for example, guiding behavior.</description>

      <title>Fictionalism about neural representations</title>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/fictionalism-about-neural-representations-2013/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction This paper articulates and explores a novel form of Mental Fictionalism: Fictionalism about the neural representations posited by cognitive science. Cognitive science appears to be committed to neural representations. These representations are claimed to be the springs of our thought and action: they drive our behaviour, determine our thoughts, memories, and inferences. However, despite the central role of neural representations in cognitive science, it is hard to explain what is meant by ‘representation’ in a way that does not incur problematic commitments.</description>

      <description>Kanaan and McGuire (2011) elegantly describe three challenges facing the use of fMRI to uncover cognitive mechanisms. They shows how these challenges ramify in the case of identifying the mechanisms responsible for psychiatric disorders. I want to raise another difficulty for fMRI that also appears to ramify in similar cases. This is that there are good reasons for doubting one of the assumptions on which many fMRI studies are based: that neural mechanisms are always and everywhere sufficient for cognition.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, it has become almost a matter of course to say that the human mind is like a computer. Folks in all walks of life talk of ‘programming’ themselves, ‘multi-tasking’, running different ‘operating systems’, and sometimes of ‘crashing’ and being ‘rebooted’. Few who have used computers have not been touched by the appeal of the idea that our inner workings somehow resemble computing machines. The success of modern day computational psychology appears to bears witness to the explanatory and predictive pay-off in positing a connection between computers and minds.</description>

      <description>William Ramsey’s Representation Reconsidered is a superb insightful analysis of the notion of mental representation in cognitive science. The book presents an original argument for a bold conclusion: partial eliminativism about mental representation in scientific psychology. According to Ramsey, once we examine the conditions that need to be satisfied for something to qualify as a representation, we can see those conditions are not fulfilled by the ‘representations’ posited by much of modern psychology.</description>

      <description>A number of papers in this volume developed out of papers presented at a conference on Computation and Cognitive Science held in King’s College, Cambridge, 7–8th July 2008. I would like to thank all the participants and speakers for making the conference such a productive and enjoyable occasion. I would also like to thank the sponsors of the conference: the British Academy, the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, King’s College, Cambridge, the Mind Association, and Microsoft Research.</description>

      <title>Realism and instrumentalism</title>

      <description>The choice between realism and instrumentalism is at the core of concerns about how our scientific models relate to reality: Do our models aim to be literally true descriptions of reality, or is their role only to be useful instruments for generating predictions? Realism about \(X\), roughly speaking, is the claim that \(X\) exists and has its nature independent of our interests, attitudes, and beliefs. An instrumentalist about \(X\) denies this.</description>

      <description>1 Introduction I do not aim to solve Kripke’s rule-following problem in this paper. I address a related problem that should be a source of worry for respondents to Kripke. This problem is as follows. Kripke’s challenge about meaning is general: it can be applied to any term in natural language. However, many responses to his challenge are specific: they aim to fix meaning for particular terms or classes of terms.</description>

      <description>In contrast to many areas of contemporary philosophy, something like a carnival atmosphere surrounds Searle’s Chinese room argument. Not many recent philosophical arguments have exerted such a pull on the popular imagination, or have produced such strong reactions. People from a wide range of fields have expressed their views on the argument. The argument has appeared in Scientific American, television shows, newspapers, and popular science books. Preston and Bishop’s recent volume of essays reflects this interdisciplinary atmosphere.</description>
