<p>Alan Turing contributed to a revolutionary idea: that mental activity
is computation. Turing’s work helped lay the foundation for what is now
known as cognitive science. Today, computation is an essential element
for explaining how the mind works. In this chapter, I return to Turing’s
early attempts to understanding the mind using computation and examine
the role that Turing played in the early days of cognitive science.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="engineering-versus-psychology"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Engineering versus
psychology</h1>
<p>Turing is famous as a founding figure in artificial intelligence (AI)
but his contribution to cognitive science is less well known. The aim of
AI is to create an intelligent machine. Turing was one of the first
people to carry out research in AI, working on machine intelligence as
early as 1941 and, as Chapters 29 and 30 explain, he was responsible
for, or anticipated, many of the ideas that were later to shape AI.</p>
<p>Unlike AI, cognitive science does not aim to create an intelligent
machine. It aims instead to understand the mechanisms that are peculiar
to human intelligence. On the face of it, human intelligence is
miraculous. How do we reason, understand language, remember past events,
come up with a joke? It is hard to know how even to begin to explain
these phenomena. Yet, like a magic trick that looks like a miracle to
the audience, but which is explained by revealing the pulleys and levers
behind the stage, so human intelligence could be explained if we knew
the mechanisms that lie behind its production.</p>
<p>A first step in this direction is to examine a piece of machinery
that is usually hidden from view: the human brain. A challenge is the
astonishing complexity of the human brain: it is one of the most complex
objects in the universe, containing 100 billion neurons and a web of
around 100 trillion connections. Trying to uncover the mechanisms of
human intelligence by looking at the brain is impossible unless one has
an idea of what to look for. Which properties of the brain are relevant
to intelligence? One of the guiding and most fruitful assumptions in
cognitive science is that the relevant property of the brain for
producing intelligence is the computation that the brain performs.</p>
<p>Cognitive science and AI are related: both concern human intelligence
and both use computation. It is important to see, however, that their
two projects are distinct. AI aims to create an intelligent machine that
may or may not use the same mechanisms for intelligence as humans.
Cognitive science aims to uncover the mechanisms peculiar to human
intelligence. These two projects could, in principle, be pursued
independently.</p>
<p>Consider that if one were to create an artificial hovering machine it
is not also necessary to solve the problem of how birds and insects
hover. Today, more than 100 years after the first helicopter flight, how
birds and insects hover is still not understood. Similarly, if one were
to create an intelligent machine, one need not also know how humans
produce intelligent behaviour. One might be sanguine about AI but
pessimistic about cognitive science. One might think that engineering an
intelligent machine is possible, but that the mechanisms of human
intelligence are too messy and complex to understand. Alternatively, one
might think that human intelligence can be explained, but that the
engineering challenge of building an intelligent machine is outside our
reach.</p>
<p>In Turing’s day, optimism reigned for AI and the cognitive-science
project took a back seat. Fortunes have now reversed. Few AI researchers
aim to create the kind of general, human-like, intelligence that Turing
envisioned. In contrast, cognitive science is regarded as a highly
promising research project.</p>
<p>Cognitive science and AI divide roughly along the lines of psychology
versus engineering. Cognitive science aims to understand human
intelligence; AI aims to engineer an intelligent machine. Turing’s
contribution to the AI project is well known. What did Turing contribute
to the cognitive-science project? Did he intend his computational models
as psychological models as well as engineering blueprints?</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="building-brainy-computers"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Building brainy computers</h1>
<p>Turing rarely discussed psychology directly in his work. There is
good evidence, however, that he saw computational models as shedding
some light on human psychology.</p>
<p>Turing was fascinated by the idea of building a <em>brain-like</em>
computer. His B-machines were inspired by his attempt to reproduce the
action of the brain, as described in Chapter 29. Turing talked about his
desire to build a machine to ‘imitate a brain’, to ‘mimic the behaviour
of the human computer’, ‘to take a man … and to try to replace … parts
of him by machinery … [with] some sort of “electronic brain”’, he
claimed that ‘it is not altogether unreasonable to describe digital
computers as brains’, and that ‘our main problem [is] how to programme a
machine to imitate a brain’.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Evidently, Turing thought that the tasks in AI engineering and
psychology were somehow related. What did he think was the nature of
their relationship? We should distinguish three different things that he
might have meant:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Psychology sets standards for engineering success</em>. Human
behaviour is where our grasp on intelligence starts. Intelligent
behaviour is, in the first instance, known to us as something that
humans do. One thing that psychology provides is a specification of
human behaviour. This description can then be used in the service of AI
by providing a benchmark for the behaviour of intelligent machines.
Whether a machine counts as intelligent depends on how well it meets an
appropriately idealized version of standards set by psychology.
Psychology is relevant to AI because it specifies what is meant by
intelligent behaviour. This connection seems peculiar to intelligent
behaviour. One could, for instance, understand perfectly well what
hovering is without knowledge of birds or insects.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Psychology as a source of inspiration for engineering</em>.
We know that the human brain produces intelligent behaviour. One way to
tackle the AI engineering problem is to examine the human brain and take
inspiration from it. Note, however, that the ‘being inspired by’
relation is a relatively weak one. Someone may be inspired by a design
without understanding much about how that design works. Someone
impressed by how birds hover may add wings to an artificial hovering
machine. But even if this were successful, it would not mean the
engineer knows how a bird’s wings enable it to hover. Indeed, the way in
which wings allows a bird to hover may not be the same as the way in
which wings allow the engineer’s artificial machine to hover – flapping
may be an essential part in one case but not the other. An AI engineer
might take inspiration from brains without knowing how brains
work</p></li>
<li><p><em>Psychology should explain human intelligence in terms of the
brain’s computational mechanisms</em>. Unlike the two previous claims,
this involves the idea that the mechanisms of human thought are
computational. The first two claims are compatible with this idea but
they do not entail it. Indeed, the first two claims are silent about
what psychology should, or should not, do. They describe a one-sided
interaction between psychology and engineering with the influence going
all from psychology to engineering: psychology sets the standards of
engineering success or psychology inspires engineering. This claim is
different: it recommends that psychology should adopt the computational
framework of the AI engineering project. The way in which we explain
human intelligence, and not just attempts to simulate it artificially,
should be computational.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Did Turing make the third (cognitive-science) claim? Turing certainly
gets close to it and, as we shall see in the final section, his work has
been used by others in the service of that claim.</p>
<p>In the quotations above, Turing describes one possible strategy for
AI: imitating the brain’s mechanisms in an electronic computer. In order
for such this strategy to work, one has to know which are the relevant
properties of the brain to imitate. Turing says that the important
features are not that ‘the brain has the consistency of cold porridge’
or any specific electrical property of nerves.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Rather, among the relevant features he cites the brain’s ability ‘to
transmit information from place to place, and also to store it’:<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>brains very nearly fall into [the class of electronic computers], and
there seems to be every reason to believe that they could have been made
to fall genuinely into it without any change in their essential
properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this still has the flavour of a one-way
interaction between AI engineering and psychology: which features of the
brain <em>are relevant to</em> AI engineering? But unlike the claims
above, this one-way interaction presupposes a specific view about how
the human brain works: that the brain produces intelligent behaviour via
(perhaps among other things) its computational properties. This is very
close to the cognitive-science claim. Turing appears to be committed to
something like to the third claim above (the cognitive-science claim)
via his engineering strategy.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with this reading of Turing. The key
terms that Turing uses – ‘reproduce’, ‘imitate’, ‘mimic’, ‘simulate’ –
have a special meaning in his work that is incompatible with the reading
above. Those terms can be read as either ‘strong’ or ‘weak’. On a strong
reading, ‘reproducing’, ‘imitating’, ‘mimicking’, or ‘simulating’ means
<em>copying that system’s inner workings</em> – copying the equivalent
of the levers and pulleys by which the system achieves its behaviour. On
a weak reading, ‘reproducing’, ‘imitating’, ‘mimicking’, or ‘simulating’
means <em>copying the system’s overall input-output behaviour</em> –
reproducing the behaviour of the system, but not necessarily the
system’s method for doing so. The strong reading requires that an
‘imitation’ of a brain work in the same way as a real brain. The weak
reading requires only that an imitation of a brain produce the same
overall behaviour.</p>
<p>We assumed the strong reading above. In Turing’s work, however, he
tended to use the weak reading. Use of the weak reading is important to
prove the computational results for which Turing is most famous (see
Chapter 7). If the weak reading is the correct one, then the
interpretation of Turing’s words above is not correct. Imitating a brain
does not require knowing how brains work – only knowing the overall
behaviour brains produce. This falls squarely under the first
relationship between psychology and engineering: psychology sets
standards for engineering success. Imitating a brain – in the (weak)
sense of reproducing the brain’s overall behaviour – requires only that
psychology specify the overall behaviour that AI should aim to
reproduce. It does not require that psychology also adopt a
computational theory about human psychology.</p>
<p>Is there evidence that Turing favoured the strong over the weak
reading? Turing wrote to the psychologist W. Ross Ashby that:<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In working on the ACE I am more interested in the possibility of
producing models of the action of the brain than in practical
applications to computing. … Thus, although the brain may in fact
operate by changing its neuron circuits by the growth of axons and
dendrites, we could nevertheless make a model, within the ACE, in which
this possibility was allowed for, but in which the actual construction
of the ACE did not alter, but only the remembered data, describing the
mode of behaviour applicable at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to show that Turing endorsed something like the
cognitive-science claim: he believed that the computational properties
of the brain are the relevant ones to capture in a simulation of a
brain. Unfortunately, it is also dogged by the same problem we saw
previously. ‘Producing a computational model of the action of the brain’
can be given either a strong or a weak reading. It could mean
<em>producing a model that works in the same way as the brain</em>
(strong), or <em>producing a model that produces the same overall
behaviour</em> (weak). Both kinds of computational model interested
Turing and Ashby. Only the former would tell in favour of the
cognitive-science claim.</p>
<p>Tantalisingly, Turing finished his 1951 BBC radio broadcast with:<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole thinking process is still rather mysterious to us, but I
believe that the attempt to make a thinking machine will help us greatly
in finding out how we think ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty is that ‘helping’, like ‘being inspired by’, is not
specific enough to pin the cognitive- science claim to Turing. There are
many ways that the attempt to make a thinking machine might help
psychology: the machines created might do useful number crunching,
building the machines may teach us high-level principles that apply to
all intelligent systems, building the machines may motivate psychology
to give a specification of human competences. None of these would commit
Turing to the cognitive-science claim.</p>
<p>Turing’s writings are consistent with the cognitive-science claim but
they do not offer unambiguous support for it. In the next section, we
will see a clearer, but different, type of influence that Turing has had
on modern-day cognitive science. In the final section, we will see how
his computational models have been taken up and used by others as
psychological models.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="from-mathematics-to-psychology"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> From mathematics to
psychology</h1>
<p>Turing proposed several computational models that have influenced
psychology. Here I focus on only one: the Turing machine. Ostensibly,
the purpose of the Turing machine was to settle questions about
mathematics – in particular, the question of which mathematical
statements can and cannot be proven by mechanical means. We will see
that Turing’s model is good for another purpose: it can be used as a
model of human thought. This spin-off benefit has been extremely
influential.</p>
<p>A Turing machine is an abstract mathematical model of a human clerk.
Imagine that a human being works by himself, mechanically, without undue
intelligence or insight, to solve a mathematical problem. Turing asks us
to compare this ‘to a machine that is only capable of a finite number of
conditions’.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> That machine, a Turing machine, has
a finite number of internal states in its head and an unlimited length
of blank tape divided into squares on which it can write and erase
symbols. At any moment, the machine can read a symbol from its tape,
write a symbol, erase a symbol, move to neighbouring square, or change
its internal state. Its behaviour is fixed by a finite set of
instructions (a transition table) that specifies what it should do next
in every circumstance (read, write, erase symbol, change state, move
head).</p>
<p>Turing wanted to know which mathematical tasks could and could not be
performed by a human clerk. Could a human clerk, given enough time and
paper, calculate any number? Could a clerk tell us which mathematical
statements are provable and which are not? Turing’s brilliance was to
see that these seemingly impossible questions about human clerks can be
answered if we reformulate them to be about Turing machines. If one
could show that the problems that can be solved by Turing machines are
the same as the problems that can be solved by a human clerk, then any
result about which problems a Turing machine can solve would carry over
to a result about which problems a human clerk can solve. Turing
machines can be proxies for human clerks in our reasoning.</p>
<p>It is easy to prove that the problems that a Turing machine can solve
can also be solved by a human clerk. The clerk could simply step through
the operations of the Turing machine by hand. Proving the converse claim
– that the problems that a human clerk can solve could also be solved by
a Turing machine – is harder. Turing offered a powerful informal
argument for this second claim. Significantly, his argument depended on
<em>psychological reasoning</em> about the human clerk:<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The behaviour of the [clerk] at any moment is determined by the
symbols which he is observing, and his ‘state of mind’ at that moment.
We may suppose that there is a bound <em>B</em> to the number of symbols
or squares that the [clerk] can observe at one moment. If he wishes to
observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose
that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is
finite. The reasons for this are of the same character as those which
restrict the number of symbols. If we admitted an infinity of states of
mind, some of them will be ‘arbitrarily close’ and will be confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turing’s strategy is to argue that the clerk cannot bring any more
internal resources to bear in solving a problem than a Turing machine.
Therefore, the class of problems that a clerk can solve is no larger
than those of a Turing machine. In conjunction with the first claim
above, this establishes the crucial claim that the problems that can be
solved by Turing machines are exactly the same as those that can be
solved by a human clerk.</p>
<p>Turing’s argument is an exercise in weak modelling. His aim is to
show that Turing machines and human clerks solve the same class of
problems: they are capable of producing the same pattern of behaviour.
His argument requires him to show that a Turing machine can copy the
behaviour of the clerk and vice versa (weak modelling). It does not
require him to show that the Turing machine reproduces that clerk’s
internal psychological mechanisms for generating his behaviour (strong
modelling). Strong modelling goes beyond what was required by Turing’s
work on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> but it is what we need for
cognitive science.</p>
<p>One might conclude that there is nothing of further interest here for
psychology. Yet, Turing’s argument should give one pause for thought.
Turing’s argument requires that human clerks and Turing machines share
at least <em>some</em> similarity in their inner working. They must have
similar kinds of internal resources; otherwise, Turing’s argument that
the clerk’s resources do not differ in kind from those of a Turing
machine would not work. This suggests that a Turing machine is more than
just a weak model of a human clerk. A Turing machine also provides a
description, albeit rather high level and abstract, of the clerk’s inner
workings. In addition to capturing the clerk’s outward behaviour, Turing
machines also give some information about the levers and pulleys behind
the clerk’s behaviour.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="your-brains-inner-turing-machine"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Your brain’s inner Turing
machine</h1>
<p>Does a Turing machine provide a psychologically realistic model of
the mechanisms of the human mind? Turing never seriously pursued this
question in print, but it has been taken up by others. The philosopher
Hilary Putnam argued that a Turing machine is a good psychological
model. Putnam claimed that a Turing machine is not only a good model of
a clerk’s mind while he is solving a mathematical task, it is a good
model of other aspects of mental life.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
According to Putnam, all human mental states (beliefs, desires,
thoughts, imaginings, feelings, pains) should be understood as states of
a Turing machine and its tape. All human mental processes (reasoning,
association, remembering) should be understood as computational steps of
some Turing machine. Psychological explanation should be explanation in
terms of the nature and operation of an inner Turing machine. Only when
one sees the brain as implementing a Turing machine can one correctly
see the contribution that the brain makes to our mental life. Putnam’s
proposal falls neatly under the cognitive-science claim identified
above.</p>
<p>Putnam and others quickly became dissatisfied with the Turing machine
as a psychological model.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It is not hard to see why. The human
brain lacks any clear ‘tape’ or ‘head’, human mental states are not
atomic states that change in a step-wise way over time, human psychology
is not serial: it involves parallel mechanisms that cooperate or compete
with each other. If the mind is a computer, it is unlikely to be a
Turing machine.</p>
<p>The past fifty years have seen an explosion in the number and variety
of computational models in psychology. State-of-the-art computational
models of the mind look and work nothing like Turing machines. Among the
most popular models are hierarchical recurrent connectionist networks
that make probabilistic predictions and implement Bayesian inference.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The mechanisms of these
computational models bear little resemblance to Turing machines. Yet,
one might wonder, is there still something essentially right, albeit
high level and abstract, about Turing machines as psychological models?
And even if Turing machines do not model all aspects of our mental life,
perhaps they provide a good model of some parts of our mental life.</p>
<p>Turing machines provide a good psychological model of at least one
part our mental life: deliberate, serial, rule-governed inference – the
capacity at work inside the head of the human clerk when he is solving
his mathematical problems. In some situations humans deliberately
arrange their mental processes to work in a rule-governed, serial way.
They attempt to follow rules without using initiative, insight, or
ingenuity, and without being disturbed by their other mental processes.
In these situations, it seems that our psychological mechanisms
approximate those of a Turing machine: our mental states appear
step-wise, as atomic entities, and change in a serial fashion.</p>
<p>At a finer level of detail – and moving closer to the workings the
brain – there is of course a more complex story to tell. Yet, as a
‘high-level’ computational model, the Turing machine is not bad as a
piece of psychology. In certain situations, and at a high, abstract,
level of description, our brains implement a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Modern computational models of the mind are massively parallel,
exhibit complex and delicate dynamics, and operate with probability
distributions rather than discrete symbols. How can one square them with
Turing machines? One way to integrate the two models is to use the idea
that a Turing machine runs as a <em>virtual machine</em> on these
models.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The idea is that a Turing machine
arises, as an emergent phenomenon, out of some lower-level computational
processes.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/turing-s-model-of-the-mind-2017/#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This idea should be familiar from
electronic PCs: a high-level computation (in C# or Java) can arise out
of lower-level computation (in assembler or microcode). High-level and
low-level computational descriptions are both important when we explain
how an electronic PC works. Similarly, we should expect that high-level
and low-level descriptions will be important to explain how the human
brain produces intelligence.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Turing has had a huge influence on cognitive science but, as we have
seen, tracing the precise course of his influence is complex. In this
chapter, we looked at two possible sources: Turing’s discussion of how
AI should be proceed, and the way in which Turing’s computational models
have influenced others. On the first score, we saw that Turing rarely
talked about how AI should influence psychology, and that it is not easy
to attribute to Turing the modern-day claim that human psychology should
be computational. On the second, a clearer picture emerges. Turing’s
1936 paper on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> suggests that Turing
machines are more than weak models of human psychology. Putnam and
others took up this idea and proposed that Turing machines are strong
models of human psychology. This idea remains influential today. Despite
the wide range of exotic computational models in cognitive science,
Turing machines still appear to capture a fundamental, albeit high-level
truth about the workings of the human mind.</p>
