                                <p>The predictive processing framework includes a broad set of ideas,
which might be articulated and developed in a variety of ways,
concerning how the brain may leverage predictive models when
implementing perception, cognition, decision-making, and motor control.
This article provides an up-to-date introduction to the two most
influential theories within this framework: predictive coding and active
inference. The first half of the paper (Sections 2–5) reviews the
evolution of predictive coding, from early ideas about efficient coding
in the visual system to a more general model encompassing perception,
cognition, and motor control. The theory is characterized in terms of
the claims it makes at Marr’s computational, algorithmic, and
implementation levels of description, and the conceptual and
mathematical connections between predictive coding, Bayesian inference,
and variational free energy (a quantity jointly evaluating model
accuracy and complexity) are explored. The second half of the paper
(Sections 6–8) turns to recent theories of active inference. Like
predictive coding, active inference models assume that perceptual and
learning processes minimize variational free energy as a means of
approximating Bayesian inference in a biologically plausible manner.
However, these models focus primarily on planning and decision-making
processes that predictive coding models were not developed to address.
Under active inference, an agent evaluates potential plans (action
sequences) based on their expected free energy (a quantity that combines
anticipated reward and information gain). The agent is assumed to
represent the world as a partially observable Markov decision process
with discrete time and discrete states. Current research applications of
active inference models are described, including a range of simulation
work, as well as studies fitting models to empirical data. The paper
concludes by considering future research directions that will be
important for further development of both models.</p>
