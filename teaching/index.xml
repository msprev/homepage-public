      <title>The Computational Mind</title>
      <link>https://marksprevak.com/teaching/computational-mind-ug/</link>

      <guid>https://marksprevak.com/teaching/computational-mind-ug/</guid>
      <description>Course description This course introduces students to the idea that the mind is a computational device. Computational models dominate modern psychology. Computational models appear to offer the tantalising prospect of explaining how the mind works. These models raise numerous foundational philosophical questions. They also appear to have the potential to contribute to, and perhaps even answer, long-standing philosophical questions about the mind.
This course does not assume prior knowledge of computational modelling techniques or cognitive science.</description>

      <description>Course description Classes for this course are shared with those of the undergraduate version of the course.
In addition to classes, the MSc version of the course has a reading group on more advanced topics. This is intended to provide a venue to explore ideas for writing a research-focused essay.
MSc reading group The reading group meets every 2 weeks. Readings are chosen in consultation with the MSc students. This year, we are reading:</description>

Please note that this is personal advice and not to be taken as a substitute for the undergraduate handbook and marking scheme.
