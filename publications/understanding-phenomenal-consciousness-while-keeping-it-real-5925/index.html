<p><em>Being You</em> is a beautifully written book about consciousness.
It pulls off the seemingly impossible trick of being a deeply personal
account of the author’s own life and conscious experiences while also
being a substantial contribution to the philosophy and science of
consciousness. On the latter score, the intentions of this book are
broad and programmatic. It sketches an agenda for a pragmatic,
scientific approach to consciousness that has a different character to
more familiar research programmes (e.g. the global workspace theory or
proposals about higher-order thought). The book is interspersed with
reports from empirical research studies and well-chosen examples from
literature, film, and the arts. Seth is exceptionally good at explaining
complex scientific ideas in clear, concise, and accessible ways.
Particular highlights are his introductions to integrated information
theory and the free-energy principle – I would recommend these as the
first things someone new to these topics should read.</p>
<p>Seth says that his book is about what he calls the ‘real problem’ of
consciousness, which he distinguishes from the hard problem of
consciousness. The hard problem is to explain how and why phenomenal
consciousness arises inside a physical world. The real problem takes the
brute existence of phenomenal consciousness for granted – it does not
attempt to explain how our experience arises from purely physical
ingredients. Instead, it suggests that a science of consciousness should
aim to give us the tools to <em>explain</em>, <em>predict</em>, and
<em>control</em> our phenomenal experiences. This may include searching
for neural correlates of phenomenal consciousness as well as building
computational theories that capture general principles about how
physical goings on in our brains and bodies are systematically linked
with certain types of conscious feeling. Seth argues that science
sometimes offers us an understanding of a mysterious target phenomena,
not by reducing it to something else, but by making it more predictable,
weaving it into our wider explanatory practices, and placing it under
our instrumental control. These broader scientific goals – which may or
may not be accompanied by a successful metaphysical reduction – are
often obscured in philosophy by an overly narrow focus on the hard
problem.</p>
<p>Focusing on the real problem of consciousness is not, however,
intended to mean that we give up on the hard problem, or at least, not
forever. Seth suggests that tackling the real problem could provide an
indirect means of addressing the hard problem. The idea is that, as we
acquire more powerful models which allow us to explain, predict, and
control phenomenal consciousness, phenomenal consciousness will, by
degrees, become less puzzling to us. In the limit – if phenomenal
consciousness and its relationship to the physical world were
<em>completely</em> modelled by a quantitative, well-confirmed
scientific theory – its brute occurrence might begin to seem completely
ordinary and unexceptional to us, at which point ‘the hard problem will
fade away, disappearing in a puff of metaphysical smoke’ (p. 28). Seth
claims that something similar happened to the phenomenon of <em>being
alive</em>. The question of which physical/functional properties are
sufficient for <em>being alive</em> no longer strikes us as a
particularly important or urgent problem for science. This is not
because we have successfully reduced <em>being alive</em> to a set of
known physical/functional conditions (we have not), but because we now
have an extensive grasp of how to explain, predict, and control many of
its associated phenomena. Solving the real problem may undercut the
motivation for an ontological reduction.</p>
<p>Seth suggests that the real problem of consciousness should be
divided into three separate questions concerning how to explain,
predict, and control the <em>level</em> of conscious experience, the
<em>contents</em> of phenomenal consciousness, and our feelings of
<em>self</em> consciousness. I will sketch his suggestions for each.</p>
<p>The idea that phenomenal consciousness comes in levels is a common
starting point for many aspects of work on consciousness. There appears
to be an obvious difference between the amount of phenomenal
consciousness inside you under general anaesthesia versus when you are
fully awake. There also appears to a difference between the amount of
phenomenal consciousness inside a rock versus that in a lively and
inquisitive five-year-old child. Seth suggests that one goal for a
science of consciousness is to make these informal ideas more precise:
to develop practical and operational numerical measures of the presence
of phenomenal consciousness, identify the neural and functional features
associated with them, and bring all this under our control via
interventions such as anesthesia and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Seth describes three candidate measures for the level of phenomenal
consciousness. These are PCI (fire a magnetic pulse into the brain,
measure how compressible are data about its electrical ripples); his own
‘causal density’ measure (based around the econometric concept of
Granger causality); and integrated information theory’s <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. Regarding the last measure, Seth
distances himself from some of the bold metaphysical claims of
integrated information theory (IIT). IIT is normally taken as saying
that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is necessarily connected
with the occurrence of phenomenological consciousness. Seth suggests
that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, like PCI and causal
density, may only be contingently connected to consciousness, and hence
it may not be a perfectly accurate measure of the level of
consciousness. In principle, a system might have high <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> and no conscious experience, or
conscious experience and low <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>.
This allows Seth to avoid some of the counterintuitive consequences of
IIT (e.g. that an inactive set of logic gates could be conscious), while
still allowing that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> plays a
useful role in science alongside other measures such as PCI and causal
density. He leaves it open whether there is one single ‘true’ measure of
the level of phenomenal consciousness (as advocates of IIT claim for
<span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>). In line with the pragmatic
character of his project, Seth suggests that this isn’t something that
can be judged ahead of enquiry.</p>
<p>Regarding the contents of consciousness, the book’s key idea is that
perception is ‘controlled hallucination’. According to Seth, this is
shorthand for a phenomenologically souped-up version of predictive
processing. Predictive processing (aka ‘predictive coding’) is a theory
about the subpersonal computational processes by which our brains
achieve perception, cognition, and action. Seth’s ‘controlled
hallucination’ view assumes that the predictive processing story is
basically correct but it adds an additional claim: certain elements of
the subpersonal predictive processing architecture <em>are</em> the
contents of our conscious experience. Specifically, Seth identifies the
contents of consciousness with the contents of our best, stable top-down
predictions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we perceive is given by the content of all the top-down
predictions together, once sensory prediction errors have been minimised
… as far as possible. (p. 106)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… top-down predictions do not merely bias our perception. They
<em>are</em> what we perceive. Our perceptual world alive with colours,
shapes, and sounds is nothing more and nothing less than our brain’s
best guess of the hidden causes of its colourless, shapeless, and
soundless sensory inputs. (p. 115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that this identity claim isn’t fully justified
inside the book. Philosophers may be surprised by this: they tend to
expect certainty and watertight arguments to defend the claim that <span
class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span>. Seth’s proposal should be understood
more in the pragmatic spirit of a conjecture or working hypothesis to
guide and structure scientific enquiry regarding the real problem. His
idea is that we should avail ourselves of a powerful quantitative
framework – predictive processing – to try to better explain, predict,
and control our phenomenal consciousness. There may be other approaches,
and this approach may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful, but its
justification lies not in evidence marshalled today, but in its eventual
success or failure.</p>
<p>That said, it is worth flagging a few doubts about the proposal. Here
are three that I had. First, according to predictive processing, good
stable top-down predictions appear at many different levels in the
neural hierarchy from retinal ganglion cells to the highest anatomical
reaches of the cortex. However, only a tiny minority of top-down
predictions appear to show up in the contents of our phenomenal
consciousness. What makes the contents of some top-down predictions
appear in phenomenal consciousness and others not? Second, the top-down
predictions are assumed to be probabilistic, but our phenomenal
experience appears to be categorical (the world seems a particular way
to us). If the contents of the two are the same, what explains this
mismatch? Third, our subjective experiences of surprise, alarm, and
confusion appear to have a distinctive phenomenology, yet they seem to
implicate bottom-up error signals rather than top-down predictions. Why
then don’t the contents of error signals also contribute to determining
the contents of phenomenal consciousness? One might ask a similar
question about precision weighting. Precision weighting scales error
signals up and down and it is associated with attentional focus and with
uncertainty about the reliability of sensory signals. Uncertainty and
attentional shifts often have particular phenomenological feelings
associated with them. Why not allow that these other aspects of the
prediction-error-minimisation machinery – distinct from top-down
predictions – may contribute to the contents of phenomenal
consciousness?</p>
<p>Seth applies his theory to affective experiences, such as emotions
and moods. He argues that affective states are top-down predictions
about interoceptive sensory data – for example, about our blood
pressure, temperature, heartbeat, breathing, and gastric tension. Those
physiological variables do not show up directly in the contents of our
conscious experience (just as the frequency and amplitude of light waves
hitting our retinas do not show up directly in consciousness). Instead,
they cause signals to travel up from our internals organs towards the
brainstem and thalamus, and these signals are met, and attempted to be
cancelled, by top-down predictions originating in the cortex. It is
these top-down predictions from the cortex that determine the contents
of consciousness. Our affective experiences are top-down predictions
about interoceptive data. The conscious state of <em>being afraid</em>
is a top-down prediction from our cortex that best explains the signals
that arrive at the brainstem arising from an elevated heart rate,
breathing, etc. (and that best fits with our priors and other
predictions based on, e.g., visual evidence). In Seth’s language, and
taking a cue from Descartes, we are ‘beast machines’: organisms that are
tuned to predict (and regulate) our body’s physiological variables. Our
brains are not organs of pure rationality but predictive regulators that
are tuned to the particularities of our bestial bodies.</p>
<p>In the final part of the book, Seth applies this ‘beast machine’ idea
to our subjective experience of ourselves as a persisting agent over
time. Despite the many changes that our bodies and minds undergo over a
lifetime, we still have a subjective experience of being the same person
– of ‘being you’. What explains this? Seth suggests that it is another
top-down prediction, albeit a higher-level one, that reflects a pattern
of stability in our bestial, interoceptive predictions. In order for us
to exist, our key physiological variables have to remain within certain
ranges – if our heartbeat were to stop, or our breathing were to cease,
we would die. Hence, given that we exist, there has to be an inherent
stability to our bestial predictions. This stability is compounded by
the action-determining character of those predictions. If a predictive
system decides to hold onto a top-down prediction with a high degree of
confidence (if it ‘clamps’ it as true), then other variables in the
system will tend to change in preference, e.g. it might revise other
predictions or cause the environment to change, so as to keep the
clamped prediction true. In this way, a prediction that is accorded a
high degree of certainty may serve as a kind of self-fulfilling
expectation. Seth suggests that we predict that we are the same over
time, not only because our key physiological variables tend to remain
within the same range over time, but also because by having a strongly
held prediction that they do remain the same, we help to keep them
within that range. Your subjective sense that there is some ‘you’ that
is stable and persisting over time arises because of the doubly-stable
nature of your top-down interoceptive predictions.</p>
<p>Seth ends his book on a cautionary note. Even if his ideas concerning
the real problem prove correct, important gaps would still remain in our
understanding of consciousness. He considers what would happen if the
predictive processing algorithm were run inside an electronic computer.
He conjectures that it would be unlikely to be accompanied by phenomenal
experience. He tentatively concludes that there is something special
about our material biological make-up that, combined with the prediction
generation machinery, breathes consciousness into us. What that special
ingredient is, however, is left open and unexplored. In the end, the
hard problem – the search to understand why certain physical conditions
give rise to phenomenal consciousness – is a difficult one to
escape.</p>
