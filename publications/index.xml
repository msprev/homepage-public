      <title>Eliminativism about consciousness</title>

      <description>1 Introduction In this chapter, we examine a radical philosophical position about consciousness: eliminativism. Eliminativists claim that consciousness does not exist and/or that talk of consciousness should be eliminated from serious science. These are strong positions to take, and require serious defence. To evaluate these positions, the chapter is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the difference between entity eliminativism and discourse eliminativism and outline the typical strategies used to support each.</description>

      <title>Realism about cognitive science</title>

      <description>1 Introduction This chapter is about a puzzle. Realism about \(X\) is often glossed as the claim that \(X\)s are mind independent: \(X\)s exist and have their nature independent of human beliefs, interests, attitudes, and other mental states. \(X\)s are out there, getting on with it, independently of human minds. How then should one understand realism about the mind? Having an answer to this is important if one wants to be a realist about cognitive science.</description>

      <title>Philosophy of the psychological and cognitive sciences</title>

      <description>1 Introduction Philosophy of the psychological and cognitive sciences is a broad and heterogeneous domain. The psychological and cognitive sciences are rapidly evolving, fragmented, and often lacking in theories that are as precise as one might like. Consequently, philosophers of science have a challenging subject matter: fast moving, variegated, and sometimes slightly fuzzy. Nevertheless, the psychological and cognitive sciences are fertile ground for philosophers. Philosophers can bring their skills to bear with productive effect: in interpreting scientific theories, precisifying concepts, exploring relations of explanatory and logical coherence between theories, and in typing psychological states, processes, and capacities.</description>

      <title>Turing&#39;s model of the mind</title>

      <description>Alan Turing contributed to a revolutionary idea: that mental activity is computation. Turing’s work helped lay the foundation for what is now known as cognitive science. Today, computation is an essential element for explaining how the mind works. In this chapter, I return to Turing’s early attempts to understanding the mind using computation and examine the role that Turing played in the early days of cognitive science.
1 Engineering versus psychology Turing is famous as a founding figure in artificial intelligence (AI) but his contribution to cognitive science is less well known.</description>

      <title>From intelligent machines to the human brain</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/from-intelligent-machines-to-the-human-brain-2015/</link>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/from-intelligent-machines-to-the-human-brain-2015/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction This chapter introduces the idea that computation is a key tool that can help us understand how the human brain works. Recent years have seen a revolution in the kinds of tasks computers can perform. Underlying these advances is the burgeoning field of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, which aims at creating machines that can act without being programmed, learning from data and experience. Rather startlingly, it turns out that the same methods that allow us to make intelligent machines also appear to hold the key to explaining how our brains work.</description>

      <title>What is consciousness?</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/what-is-consciousness-2015/</link>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/what-is-consciousness-2015/</guid>
      <description>1 The question of consciousness: Philosophical perspectives Human consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries in the universe. From one point of view this should be surprising, since we know a great deal about consciousness from our own experience. One could say that our own conscious experience is the thing in the world that we know best. Descartes wanted to build the entirety of natural science on the foundation of our understanding of our conscious thought.</description>

      <title>Group minds and explanatory simplicity</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction In three papers, Robert Rupert presents arguments against group minds (Rupert 2005, 2011, 2014) These criticisms motivate the conclusion that although the discovery of group minds is an open empirical possibility, there are strong reasons for thinking that no group minds exist. One of Rupert’s principal arguments against group minds is an argument from explanatory simplicity. His claim is that, for any explanation of intelligent behaviour that appeals to group minds, there exists an alternative explanation couched solely in terms of the minds of individuals.</description>

      <description>What makes humans unique? There are many ways in which humans differ from other primates: being bipedal, dependence on technology, social organisation, geographical range, lifespan. In The Evolved Apprentice, Sterelny takes one human novelty as central to explaining why humans are different: our power to transmit vast amounts of information across generations. Chimps and gorillas resemble their parents largely as a result of genetic inheritance. Social learning gives humans a powerful alternative for high-bandwidth, high-fidelity information transmission.</description>

      <title>Entangled externalisms</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/entangled-externalisms-2014/</link>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/entangled-externalisms-2014/</guid>
      <description>The debate between internalists and externalists is multifaceted, straddling vexed issues in contemporary philosophy. This chapter focuses on the distinction between content and vehicle as it pertains to the internalism/externalism debate in philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Whereas content internalism/externalism seeks to give an account of what makes mental states have the contents they have rather than some other contents or no contents at all, vehicle internalism/externalism seeks to give an account of the processes or mechanisms that enable mental states with contents to play a causal role in, for example, guiding behavior.</description>

      <title>Fictionalism about neural representations</title>
      <link>http://marksprevak.com/publications/fictionalism-about-neural-representations-2013/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/fictionalism-about-neural-representations-2013/</guid>
      <description>1 Introduction This paper articulates and explores a novel form of Mental Fictionalism: Fictionalism about the neural representations posited by cognitive science. Cognitive science appears to be committed to neural representations. These representations are claimed to be the springs of our thought and action: they drive our behaviour, determine our thoughts, memories, and inferences. However, despite the central role of neural representations in cognitive science, it is hard to explain what is meant by ‘representation’ in a way that does not incur problematic commitments.</description>

      <guid>http://marksprevak.com/publications/realism-and-instrumentalism-2013/</guid>
      <description>The choice between realism and instrumentalism is at the core of concerns about how our scientific models relate to reality: Do our models aim to be literally true descriptions of reality, or is their role only to be useful instruments for generating predictions? Realism about \(X\), roughly speaking, is the claim that \(X\) exists and has its nature independent of our interests, attitudes, and beliefs. An instrumentalist about \(X\) denies this.</description>
