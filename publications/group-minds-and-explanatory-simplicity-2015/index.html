<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In three papers, Robert Rupert presents arguments against group minds
<span class="citation" data-cites="Rupert05 Rupert11a Rupert12">(Rupert
2005, 2011, 2014)</span> These criticisms motivate the conclusion that
although the discovery of group minds is an open empirical possibility,
there are strong reasons for thinking that no group minds exist. One of
Rupert’s principal arguments against group minds is an argument from
<em>explanatory simplicity</em>. His claim is that, for any explanation
of intelligent behaviour that appeals to group minds, there exists an
alternative explanation couched solely in terms of the minds of
individuals. According to Rupert, an <em>individual-level
explanation</em>, which makes no reference to group minds will be
simpler than its <em>group-level</em> alternative, which does make
reference to group minds. Simpler explanations are, everything else
being equal, better explanations. Therefore, individual-level
explanations are, everything else being equal, preferable to their more
complex group-level alternatives.</p>
<p>In his invocation of the principle of explanatory simplicity, Rupert
overlooks a great deal of this notion’s complexity. We aim to explicate
this notion and its various dimensions and, in doing so, to assess the
relevance of each dimension to the issue of group-level explanation. We
conclude that, whichever way explanatory simplicity is analysed, there
is no warrant for thinking that individual-level explanations are
simpler than group-level alternatives. Hence, this particular route to
argue against the existence of group minds is blocked.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="a-tale-of-two-types-of-agent"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> A tale of two types of agent</h1>
<p>Rupert claims that no matter the intelligent behaviour a group
displays, an explanatory story involving only cognitive properties of
<em>individuals</em> is always available:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all of the cases that involve the relevant explananda, there seem
to be available complete causal explanations couched in terms of the
cognitive states of individuals (together with causal contributions of
noncognitive, physical structures). <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rupert11a">(Rupert 2011 p. 635)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rupert claims that these individual-level explanations are preferable
to group-level explanations. According to Rupert, this is because
individual-level explanations are more simple. This consideration is the
opening move in Rupert’s inference to the best explanation against the
existence of group minds.</p>
<p>Let us see an example of Rupert’s argument in action.</p>
<p>An impressive display of intelligent behaviour by a group occurs when
Microsoft develops a new operating system (OS). How does a group
(Microsoft) produce this behaviour? Two types of story could be told.
One is formulated exclusively at the level of individual agents: it
refers to the cognitive properties of individual employees, to the
interactions between employees, and to the organisational structure of
the corporation that governs these interactions. The other introduces
group agents as protagonists: it ascribes cognitive properties (such as
beliefs, desires, and intentions), not only to individual employees, but
also to groups of individuals, such as teams within Microsoft or the
corporation as a whole.</p>
<p>What do these two stories look like?</p>
<p>An individual-level explanation of Microsoft’s production of a new OS
might begin by referring to the cognitive states of the individuals
comprising the corporation’s executive: their <em>beliefs</em> that a
new OS is required; their <em>desires</em> to produce this new OS within
the next three years; and their <em>intentions</em> to undertake the
necessary activity to ensure that these desires are fulfilled. The goal
of producing a new OS can be broken down into several sub-goals: the
production of its graphical content, its software compatibility, its
compatibility with a range of hardware, and so on. Groups of programmers
would be tasked with producing the code required to achieve each of
these sub-goals and each programmer would adjust their cognitive states
accordingly.</p>
<p>Each programmer would be ascribed a set of beliefs about the
activities they would need to perform to achieve the sub-goal with which
they have been tasked: the belief that producing a satisfactory user
interface will require two years of work; the belief that a particular
programming language would be most appropriate to this task; and the
belief that weekly consultations with the corporation’s executive will
be necessary, and so on. Each programmer would have a set of relevant
desires, intentions, and other cognitive states: she might, for example,
have the desire to achieve her sub-goal within a particular time frame,
to do so to the best of her ability, to exploit her newly gained
competence with a particular programming language, and so on.</p>
<p>That an individual employee can be attributed cognitive states
requires that the individual instantiate a <em>cognitive
architecture</em>. This is to say that the individual is structured in
such a way as to comprise a set of mechanisms whose tightly integrated
activity contributes causally to that individual’s intelligent
behaviour. The <em>cognitive states</em> attributed to the individual
are realised by the integrated activity of the mechanisms which comprise
that individual’s cognitive architecture. These states enter into causal
series in which each state is caused by, and subsequently causes or
modifies, other cognitive states. These causally connected series of
cognitive states constitute <em>cognitive processes</em>. And it is in
virtue of the realisation of these cognitive processes that the
individual comes to behave intelligently and produce a wide range of
cognitive phenomena (from choosing a suitable route to work in the
morning to successfully coding a graphical user interface).</p>
<p>Thus, to treat an individual employee as genuinely <em>cognitive</em>
is to attribute to that individual a related set of <em>cognitive
properties</em>. The individual instantiates a cognitive architecture: a
set of integrated cognitive mechanisms (such as working memory, a
language processor, and visual object-recognition mechanisms). The
integrated activity of these mechanisms realises cognitive states
(beliefs, desires, and memories; representations of words, tasks, and
problems; and so on). These states are connected in causal series to
constitute cognitive processes (decision-making, problem-solving, and so
on). And in virtue of the individual’s instantiation of these various
cognitive properties, that individual is able to produce a variety of
cognitive phenomena.</p>
<p>Each individual employee is attributed in the individual-level
explanation a set of related cognitive properties. Crucially, of course,
it is only <em>individual</em> employees who are attributed cognitive
properties, not any extra-individual entity or collection of
entities.</p>
<p>An individual-level explanation of Microsoft’s behaviour would of
course need to appeal to more than this. It would need to refer to the
various processes by which individual employees communicate the content
of their cognitive states, and the results of their cognitive processes,
to other employees. These communicative processes would include
face-to-face linguistic interactions, the production of written memos,
email, video-conferencing, record-keeping, and so on. An
individual-level explanation would also need to refer to the
non-cognitive physical structures used to facilitate individual
cognitive processes and inter-individual communicative processes. A
corporation like Microsoft makes use of all sorts of digital computers,
hard drives and other storage devices, telecommunications devices, and
old-fashioned pen and paper, amongst other things. Finally, of crucial
importance would be a description of the corporation’s organisational
structure and the procedures and rules which determine how the activity
of its numerous individual employees is coordinated and channelled
towards the production of a new OS. This would include reference to sets
of implicit and explicit rules, the hierarchical organisation of
employees, the corporation’s departmental structure, the procedural
standards for communication between departments, and so on.</p>
<p>An individual-level causal explanation of Microsoft’s production of a
new OS would clearly be a complex and multifaceted explanation that
would make reference to an enormous number of individual cognitive
properties, interactive and communicative processes, rules and
organisational structures, and various non-cognitive structures and
processes.</p>
<p>What about the group-level story? A group-level explanation would
ascribe cognitive properties, not only to individual employees, but also
to groups of individuals. The relevant groups may be of various sizes
and their membership could overlap. The groups may include small teams
of programmers, larger engineering teams, entire software divisions, or
the corporation as a whole. Just as individual employees are attributed
a set of related cognitive properties, so a group would be treated as a
cognitive system that instantiates a cognitive architecture and realises
cognitive states that combine in causal series to constitute cognitive
processes.</p>
<p>For example, Microsoft’s organisational structure, which plays the
crucial role of integrating and coordinating the activity of individual
employees in the individual-level explanation, may be equated with a
cognitive architecture. This architecture is comprised of a large set of
mechanisms whose activation may realise cognitive states. But whereas
the cognitive mechanisms comprising an individual employee’s cognitive
architecture consist of various neural systems in the employee’s brain,
the cognitive mechanisms that comprise Microsoft’s cognitive
architecture consist of groups of individual employees and their
supporting physical apparatus. The group-level cognitive states are
realised by individual employees in interaction with each other and with
their supporting physical apparatus. The group-level cognitive processes
are the causal series in which each of these cognitive states is caused
by, and causes or modifies, the others.</p>
<p>This presentation of the group-level explanation suggests that it is
a rival to the individual-level explanation in the sense that it might
eliminate the need for any individual-level talk: individual-level
cognitive properties, inter-individual interaction, and non-cognitive
physical structures would be discarded in favour of group cognitive
properties. But it need not be so. We will suppose in what follows that
the group-level explanation retains reference to the various
individual-level cognitive properties and non-cognitive physical
structures described in the individual-level explanation.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the similarity between a particular group and
a cognitive agent is too superficial, or in other ways insufficient, to
justify attribution of cognitive properties to that group. Both
advocates and critics of group cognition agree that some level of
functional similarity – the correct level of which is disputed – between
a group and an individual cognitive agent is required in order for the
attribution of mental properties to a group to be warranted at all.
Nevertheless, in order to facilitate a discussion of explanatory
simplicity, these considerations will be temporarily set aside. The
claim at issue is not that Microsoft’s production of a new OS genuinely
constitutes a real-world example of group cognition. The claim is that,
<em>if</em> a case such as the Microsoft example did warrant both an
individual-level and a group-level explanation, and <em>if</em> two such
complete causal explanations <em>could indeed be given</em>, the
individual-level explanation would be superior in terms of explanatory
simplicity.</p>
<p>Granted our task is to assess explanatory simplicity (and not some
other dimension of adequacy of group-level explanation), it is important
to tally up, as Rupert does, the nature and quantity of additional
postulates made by group-level explanation. The additional postulates of
group-level explanation consist of an additional set of cognitive
properties: the instantiation, in virtue of the corporation’s
organisational structure, of a cognitive architecture; the realisation,
in virtue of this architecture, of cognitive states over and above those
realised by individual employees; and the realisation via the causal
series of these cognitive states, of cognitive processes over and above
those realised by individual employees.</p>
<p>Assuming, as per the above concession, that the group-level
explanation retains reference to all individual-level cognitive
properties and non-cognitive physical structures, the two explanations
appear to sit roughly in a relation of containment. The group-level
explanation posits all that the individual-level explanation posits,
plus an additional set of properties, the group-level cognitive
properties. Therefore it seems reasonable to conclude, as Rupert does,
that individual-level explanation must be the simpler hypothesis. If one
can explain the group’s behaviour without introducing additional
cognitive properties possessed by groups, why, everything else being
equal, introduce those group-level cognitive properties?</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to show that this conclusion is unwarranted.
Individual-level explanation is not simpler than, and hence (all else
being equal) preferable to, group-level explanation. Our strategy in
this paper is to examine how simplicity should be measured. We consider
three approaches: qualitative parsimony, qualitative parsimony, and
theoretical elegance. We argue that on none of these measures does
individual-level explanation count as more simple than group-level
explanation. We conclude that concerns about simplicity cannot be
straightforwardly used, as Rupert wants, to argue against the existence
of group minds.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="qualitative-parsimony"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Qualitative parsimony</h1>
<p>One dimension of simplicity is parsimony. Parsimony concerns the
number of entities posited by an explanation. How does one go about
counting these entities? There seem to be two possibilities: count the
<em>kinds</em> of entity postulated or count the <em>number of
entities</em> postulated and subsumed under each kind. Counting the
number of kinds gives a measure of <em>qualitative</em> parsimony;
counting the number of entities subsumed under each kind gives a measure
of <em>quantitative</em> parsimony <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lewis73">(Lewis 1973)</span>. Qualitative parsimony is the
focus of this section; quantitative parsimony is the focus of the
next.</p>
<p>How do considerations of qualitative parsimony apply in the Microsoft
case? On the assumption that both the individual-level and group-level
explanations are otherwise adequate, the individual-level explanation
might appear more qualitatively parsimonious for the simple fact that it
includes only those kinds that are already in use throughout standard
cognitive science. In other words, the individual-level explanation
helps itself only to the cognitive kinds of architecture, state, and
process that are already attributed to individual humans in cognitive
scientific explanations. In contrast, the group-level explanation of the
Microsoft’s production of a new OS makes additional postulates: it
attributes cognitive properties to Microsoft at the group-level.</p>
<p>It is of crucial importance, however, to the group-level explanation
that the additional postulates involve attribution of <em>the same
kind</em> of properties to Microsoft as are attributed to its individual
employees. The architecture that the group-level explanation takes
Microsoft to instantiate is, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, of the same
cognitive kind as the architecture instantiated by individuals. And the
states and processes that Microsoft is attributed in virtue of its
instantiating this cognitive architecture are again, <em>ex
hypothesi</em>, cognitive states and processes of the same kind as are
attributed to its individual humans.</p>
<p>The cognitive states attributed to Microsoft are <em>additional
instances</em> of individual-level cognitive states: beliefs, desires,
intentions, and so on. The group-level states are individually distinct
from any of the individual-level cognitive states attributed to
particular employees. But the group-level states are individually
distinct in the sense that they constitute new instances of the same
cognitive kind as are attributed to individual employees. The claim –
the innovation – that makes the group-level explanation of Microsoft’s
production of a new OS interesting is that Microsoft instantiates
additional instances of the same kind of cognitive properties as are
attributed to individual humans. The same is true of any group-level
cognitive explanation. These explanations are interesting precisely
because of the similarity they posit between individual-level properties
and group-level properties. A group-level explanation that attributed
utterly alien cognitive properties – so different as to fail to fall
under any same-kind relation to those of individual humans – would not
count as a group <em>mind</em> hypothesis at all.</p>
<p>Understood correctly, group-level explanations do not postulate
additional cognitive kinds, only additional instances of existing kinds.
Therefore, an appeal to qualitative parsimony as a strategy to argue
against group-level explanations would miss the mark. There are no
extraneous kinds to ‘shave off’ by dispensing with group-level
explanation, only attribution of existing kinds to new particulars.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="quantitative-parsimony"><span

<p>Might group-level explanations be less simple than individual-level
alternatives because group-level explanations postulate extra instances
of cognitive kinds? Does a group-level explanation of, say, Microsoft’s
behaviour introduce unnecessary instances of cognitive architecture,
states and processes? In this section, we argue that concerns about
quantitative parsimony do not tell against group-level explanation.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Nolan97">Nolan (1997)</span>
provides an instructive case study on the value of quantitative
parsimony. Nolan’s case concerns the postulation of the neutrino in the
explanation of beta decay. In attempting to explain a puzzling drop in
the energy of nuclei during beta decay, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the
existence of a new kind of subatomic particle, the neutrino. When
developing the neutrino-based explanation, there was no available means
of determining how many of the new subatomic particles were released
during beta decay. The total mass-energy to be accounted was known, but
whether this mass-energy was best accounted by one, two, or a million
neutrinos was an open question. Once the release of a single neutrino
has been postulated, why not postulate the release of two neutrinos each
with half the mass-energy of one neutrino? Or a million neutrinos with a
millionth of the mass-energy? At the time, the one-neutrino and the
million-neutrino explanations could both have accommodated the empirical
data. Nolan argues that it was nevertheless rational, in light of
consideration of quantitative parsimony, for Pauli to favour the
one-neutrino explanation. Nolan defends this in two ways.</p>
<p>First, one may make a brute appeal to intuition. That the
one-neutrino explanation is superior to the million-neutrino explanation
(or any other such explanation) is an intuition that many otherwise
rational enquirers share. It may seem reasonable to endorse this, at
least pending countervailing evidence, even if it does not admit of
explicit justification. Second, one may appeal to the successful track
record of quantitatively parsimonious explanations. Quantitative
parsimony has led to the selection of explanations that have gone on to
prove their worth in other ways. A case in point is the one-neutrino
explanation. Pauli’s explanation was subsequently vindicated. Even if
the reasons for the success of quantitative parsimony remain obscure,
its success alone appears to lend some justification to the principle’s
continued application.</p>
<p>The cases in which quantitative parsimony play a part might seem
trivial when the number of entities postulated (for example, atoms or
subatomic particles) is compared with the potentially infinite number of
other entities in the universe. This seems to pose a problem if one
endorses an ‘infinite ontology’ view of the universe. One could argue
that against this infinite background, a numerical increase in entities
of one particular kind is trivial or negligible. Why should it matter
that an explanation adds a few more entities to our scientific ontology
when this ontology already includes the infinity of other kinds of
entities which occupy an infinite universe?</p>
<p>Against this thought, Nolan contends that, irrespective of the
potential infinity of entities subsumed under all extant kinds, it is
nevertheless important to minimise the number of entities subsumed by
any one particular kind. Thus, for example, even against the background
of infinite mathematical entities to which the mathematical Platonist is
committed, the addition of ‘seventeen million little neutral particles
being produced in every case of Beta-decay’, as opposed to the addition
of just one such particle, still makes a significant difference <span
class="citation" data-cites="Nolan97">(Nolan 1997 p. 340)</span>.</p>
<p>We will follow Nolan in his understanding of quantitative parsimony.
Recall that the group-level explanation claims that Microsoft, as a
group, instantiates a cognitive architecture with instances of cognitive
states over and above those of its individual employees. Is an
individual-level explanation more quantitatively parsimonious than this
group-level account (assuming, as above, that both explanations can be
given)?</p>
<p>At first glance, the answer appears to be a clear ‘yes’. At the end
of the previous section we said that the group-level explanation posits
extra <em>instances</em> of cognitive architectures, states, and
processes, although it does not posit new kinds. Granted this, the
group-level explanation appears to do worse in terms of quantitative
parsimony: it posits more instances of cognitive properties than
individual-level explanation. On closer examination, however, the case
against group-level explanation is not so clear.</p>
<p>An initial objection that might be levelled by an advocate of
individual-level explanation is that the group-level explanation
attributes to the Microsoft corporation a <em>cognitive
architecture</em>, whilst at the same time appealing to the cognitive
architectures of the individual employees. If this attribution involves
the postulation of an additional entity, then it seems to fall foul of
considerations of quantitative parsimony when compared to
individual-level alternatives.</p>
<p>Understood correctly, however, the group-level explanation does not
postulate the instantiation of a cognitive architecture as an
<em>additional</em> entity over and above those postulated in the
individual-level explanation. Rather, it <em>identifies</em> the
organisational structure of the corporation, as described in the
individual-level explanation, with a genuinely cognitive architecture.
The individual-level explanation must already include this
organisational structure in order to explain the interactions that take
place between the corporation’s individual employees. It is committed to
there being an executive, external information stores, a variety of
sub-components in the form of teams of individual employees, and various
other non-cognitive physical structures. In order to make sense of the
interactions between these features and to explain how they are
coordinated in the production of a new OS, the individual-level
explanation cannot merely postulate their existence. It must also give
an account of the rules and procedures governing their interaction.</p>
<p>In attributing to the corporation a cognitive architecture, the
group-level explanation does not postulate an extra structure over and
above the structure already described at the individual-level. It claims
that, properly understood, this structure <em>is</em> an instance of a
cognitive architecture.</p>
<p>What about the additional cognitive states and processes? It seems
that they must violate the principle of quantitative parsimony. Even if
Microsoft as a corporation instantiates a cognitive architecture, an
advocate of quantitative parsimony could say that the cognitive states
attributed to the corporation in the group-level explanation constitute
extraneous additions to number of instances of cognitive states
postulated in the individual-level explanation. The individual-level
explanation makes reference to the cognitive states of individual
employees. The group-level explanation makes reference to these
cognitive states plus an extra set of cognitive states at group level.
The group-level explanation therefore seems inferior in terms of
quantitative parsimony.</p>
<p>Let us pause and consider this more carefully. First, we need to ask
how the instances of cognitive states postulated by each explanation are
counted. Consider the cognitive state of <em>intending to develop a new
OS</em>. Let us suppose that the individual-level explanation attributes
this state to the corporation’s CEO, amongst other individual employees.
The group-level explanation retains these attributions and,
additionally, attributes the state of <em>intending to develop a new
OS</em> to the corporation as a whole.</p>
<p>Here is one method by which we could go about counting cognitive
states. Beginning with the CEO, we say that his state of intending to
develop a new OS is one cognitive state to which the individual-level
explanation is committed. On top of this, let us suppose that he
simultaneously <em>believes</em> that the development of a new OS is a
financial necessity. This gives us two cognitive states. Simultaneously,
he <em>desires</em> to make as much money as possible for the
corporation during his time as CEO, giving us a total of three cognitive
states. Assuming, for the sake of brevity, that the CEO’s cognitive
states are limited to only these three, we could go on to count the
cognitive states of all the other individual employees in a similar
manner. At the end of this process, we add up the cognitive states that
have been attributed to each individual employee, and this gives us the
total number of cognitive states to which the individual-level
explanation is committed.</p>
<p>Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the group-level explanation
is committed to those individual-level cognitive states too. But it goes
further and attributes cognitive states at the group-level. We count
these group-level cognitive states, add them to the total number of
individual-level cognitive states, and this gives us the number of
cognitive states to which the group-level explanation is committed.
Patently, using this method of counting cognitive states, the
group-level explanation is committed to a greater number of cognitive
states than the individual-level explanation.</p>
<p>This method of counting cognitive states gives us the total number of
<em>occurrent</em> cognitive states attributed by the explanations. The
method might seem appealing. However, it relies on an implausibly
atomistic view of the nature of cognitive states.</p>
<p>Cognitive states ought not to be treated as entities in the same way
as material objects whose existence can be treated independently of the
existence of all other such objects. If we are counting the number of
chairs in a room, then counting only the ‘occurrent’ chairs – those that
are present in the room at one particular point in time – is
unproblematic. The existence of each of these chairs, and the location
of each chair, stands largely independent of the existence or location
of any other chair. The existence of any single chair, and the location
of the chair, entails almost nothing about the existence or location of
any other chair. Cognitive states are different, or so the objection
goes. The fact that a cognitive architecture instantiates a particular
cognitive state at a given moment in time <em>does</em> entail further
facts about other cognitive states. The existence of a particular
cognitive state cannot be treated in isolation from other cognitive
states.</p>
<p>This approach to cognitive states falls under the broad heading of
<em>dispositionalism</em>. The core of dispositionalist theories – the
idea that is of the greatest significance for the discussion of
group-level cognitive states – can be illustrated by some simple
examples. We will give these to demonstrate the strength of the view as
a broadly correct characterisation of cognitive states, and superior to
the occurrent characterisation above.</p>
<p>Consider that <em>I believe that my house contains six rooms</em>. At
a given point in time I am laying down plans for my latest DIY project
and this has given me cause to think about the total number of rooms in
my house. I say to myself ‘there are six rooms in my house’. It seems
entirely reasonable that at this given point in time, we should
attribute to me the occurrent belief <em>that my house has six
rooms</em>. It seems uncontroversial that I have at least this one
belief at this point in time.</p>
<p>What about the belief <em>that my house contains more than three
rooms</em>? I might never have cause during the course of my DIY project
to entertain this as a proposition, and it might plausibly be the case
that at no point in my life does the belief <em>that my house contains
more than three rooms</em> ever become occurrent. Does this mean that I
do not believe that my house contains more than three rooms? Maintaining
that I do not seems to neglect a crucial feature of beliefs. I am
<em>disposed</em> to assent to statements or answer questions in
accordance with the non-occurrent belief.</p>
<p>It is the important sense in which I believe <em>that my house
contains more than three rooms</em>, regardless of the actual occurrence
of this belief, which is captured by the dispositionalist claim we are
interested in here. The claim is that, in virtue of the structure
possessed by my cognitive architecture, I am disposed to respond in a
particular way to a whole set of possible stimuli and other
dispositional mental states – to assent to a whole set of possible
statements, to answer questions in a particular way, and so on.</p>
<p>Returning to Microsoft example, the CEO was attributed three
cognitive states, one of which was the intention to develop a new OS.
Construed in dispositional terms, however, his single state of intending
entails many others. If the CEO intends to develop a new OS, he
presumably also intends to develop a new OS which can be made available
for the use of Microsoft’s customers. He intends that this OS will run
successfully on existing hardware, that it will enable the use of more
than one piece of software, and so on. And these entailments are not
limited to intentions. If the CEO intends to develop a new OS he
presumably also <em>believes</em> that the development of a new OS is
possible, and he believes that it is within the capability of the
corporation to develop a new OS. Presumably he also has beliefs about
what an OS is, what a corporation is, and his position within the
corporation such that he can intend to develop a new OS in the first
place, and so on.</p>
<p>To say that the CEO instantiates the cognitive state of intending to
develop a new OS but none of the other inferentially-related cognitive
states seems to neglect an essential feature of what it is to
instantiate a cognitive state. We want to suggest, then, that cognitive
states are not best characterised as solely occurrent states. Rather, in
virtue of having a cognitive architecture and instantiating cognitive
states, the CEO possesses a whole set of related dispositional mental
states.</p>
<p>If we treat cognitive states in dispositional terms, how do we count
them?</p>
<p>There are presumably limits in principle to the number of occurrent
states that a single cognitive architecture can instantiate at any given
point in time, even if those limits are difficult to discern. Limited
neural resources and limited number of cognitive mechanisms that
comprise the cognitive architecture of an individual of finite size mean
that the number of occurrent cognitive states instantiated at any given
moment is finite.</p>
<p>In contrast, the number of dispositions that an individual has, in
virtue of their instantiating a cognitive architecture is, in principle,
unlimited. If I believe <em>that my house contains six rooms</em>, and I
also believe <em>that my house contains more than three rooms</em>,
presumably I also believe <em>that my house contains fewer than seven
rooms</em>. I am disposed to assent to the statement that my house
contains fewer than seven rooms. Surely, then, I also believe <em>that
my house contains fewer than eight rooms</em>, and fewer than nine
rooms, and ten rooms, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. Construed
dispositionally, there is no point in this sequence at which it makes
sense to terminate. There is no principled limit on the number of rooms
to which I would be disposed to respond <em>that my house contains
fewer</em>.</p>
<p>In the Microsoft case, there is likewise no principled limit to the
number of cognitive states we should attribute to its CEO once it has
been accepted that he intends to develop a new OS. The simplest example
of this fact could be given just by considering that, if the CEO intends
to develop <em>one</em> new OS, he also intends to develop <em>less than
two</em> new OSs, and <em>less than three</em> new OS, and so on. It is
not just that the limits to the number of these cognitive states are
difficult to discern. Rather, there are no such limits. There seems,
then, to be the very real possibility that, construed in dispositional
terms, the number of instances of cognitive states falling under each
kind in individual-level explanation of Microsoft’s behaviour is
<em>unlimited</em>.</p>
<p>If individual-level explanation is committed to an unlimited number
of instances of cognitive states (beliefs, intentions, desires, etc.),
then the addition of further instances of these kinds attributed to
groups would offer no overall increase in number. Even if the number of
group-level cognitive instances were similarly unlimited, there would
still be no overall increase. This is bad news for anyone wishing to use
quantitative parsimony to argue in favour of individual-level
explanation. Our first intuition that the number of individual cognitive
states plus the number of group cognitive states must be greater than
the number of individual cognitive states breaks down once we introduce
an unlimited number of dispositional cognitive states.</p>
<p>Despite its initial intuitive plausibility, quantitative parsimony
does not lend credence to individual-level explanation being more simple
than group-level explanation. Insofar as cognitive property instances
can be counted at all, adding further instances via group-level
explanation does not increase our total commitments.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="theoretical-elegance"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Theoretical elegance</h1>
<p>The final measure of explanatory simplicity we consider is
<em>theoretical elegance</em>. Theoretical elegance concerns the
structure and length of the explanation, rather than the entities or
kinds to which it is committed.<a href="https://marksprevak.com/publications/group-minds-and-explanatory-simplicity-2015/#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Two ways of understanding theoretical elegance are considered below:
explanations that minimise the number of primitive predicates employed,
and explanations that minimise the length of the explanation. We argue
that neither provides the grounds for thinking that individual-level
explanations are more simple than group-level alternatives.</p>
<p>Explanations employ primitive and non-primitive predicates. Both
kinds of predicate are used to express the ideas that a theory contains.
The primitive predicates are those which are undefined: they receive no
definition or analysis within the explanation. The non-primitive
predicates are defined: they receive a definition in terms of the
predicates included elsewhere within the explanation.</p>
<p>In the Microsoft example, the primitive predicates might include
<em>has the belief that a new OS is required</em>, <em>has the desire to
produce the new OS within the next three years</em>, and so on.
Additionally, many predicates related to the non-cognitive properties of
physical structures and the predicates needed to explain the
organisation of the corporation are likely to be primitive.</p>
<p>According to our assumption in Section 2, the group-level explanation
will include all the primitive predicates of the individual-level
explanation. The additional postulates in the group-level explanation
are the group-level cognitive properties, and therefore the only
additional predicates in the group-level explanation could be those
predicates relating specifically to the instantiation of cognitive
properties at the group-level: those needed to explain why and how a
group-level architecture is a <em>group-level</em> architecture; why and
how the additional states being postulated are <em>group-level</em>
states, and so on.</p>
<p>These group-level predicates are the subject matter of group-level
explanations and will therefore need to be explained and defined within
the group-level explanation. These group-level predicates will
<em>not</em> remain undefined because it is the concern of such an
explanation to explain why and how cognitive properties are instantiated
at the group level, and what it means to have the group-level properties
in the sense intended by the explanation. Therefore, the (additional)
group-level predicates will not be primitive.</p>
<p>This means that the group-level explanation will not include any more
primitive predicates than the individual-level explanation. So, with
regard to elegance <em>qua</em> minimum number of primitive predicates,
group-level explanations are no worse off than individual-level
explanations.</p>
<p>If the Microsoft group-level explanation replaces reference to
individual-level cognitive properties and the various non-cognitive
physical structures mentioned in the individual-level explanation with
reference to only a single cognitive system and its properties,
group-level explanation could be shorter. Even if group-level
explanation retains reference to all the properties and structures of
individual-level explanation, there will nevertheless be aspects of the
group’s activity whose lengthy individual-level explanations can be
replaced with shorter group-level explanations.</p>
<p>For example, consider retrieval of information from a non-cognitive
information store, such as a hard drive. For an individual-level
explanation, this would need to be explained with description of an
individual employee’s processes of interaction with the hard drive and
how information on the hard drive influences that individual’s cognitive
states and processes. This would involve, for example, facts about the
physical encoding of the information on the hard drive, the content of
the information, the employee’s sensory interaction with the hard drive,
their conceptualisation of the information, and their endorsement of the
information. The explanation may plausibly draw on other elements too,
such as translation between natural languages in order for the employee
to capable of conceptualising the information in the first place. The
explanation also needs to explain how, once the information has affected
the cognitive states of an individual, this then affects the behaviour
of the corporation as a whole.</p>
<p>In a group-level explanation, this set of processes by which the
information contained on a hard drive comes to influence an individual’s
cognitive states and processes, and by which these states and processes
are communicated to and influence other individual employees, could be
given a much shorter explanation in terms of <em>the corporation</em>’s
group-level cognitive states being influenced by states of <em>the
corporation</em>’s long-term memory. Thus, even if group-level
explanation elsewhere retains reference to the same individual-level
cognitive properties and non-cognitive structures as individual-level
explanation, there will be cases where group-level explanation can
compress non-trivial sets of statements made by the individual-level
explanation of certain processes.</p>
<p>This mirrors a discussion by <span class="citation"
data-cites="ClarkChalmers98">Clark &amp; Chalmers (1998)</span> of the
appeal of the extended mind hypothesis. Clark and Chalmers argue that
when explaining Otto’s behaviour, certain stages in the explanation
become unnecessary once one switches to an explanation couched in terms
of a single extended cognitive system (p. 13). The description of Otto’s
transit to The Museum of Modern Art need not, they argue, make reference
to Otto’s belief that The Museum of Modern Art’s location is recorded in
his notebook, or to the fine-grained details of Otto’s sensorimotor
interaction with his notebook (p. 13). In the extended-mind version of
the explanation, this whole process is glossed simply as the retrieval
of information from Otto’s long-term extended memory in the service of
fulfilling his desires. The non-extended alternative involving a detour
through Otto’s beliefs about his notebook takes ‘one step too many’ and
is ‘pointlessly complex’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>Likewise, if a group-level explanation of Microsoft’s production of a
new OS is available, many stages of the individual-level explanation
seem pointlessly complex. Ensembles of processes can be glossed as the
execution of a single group-level cognitive process, such as retrieval
of information from long-term memory. The set of statements describing
this will be significantly shorter than the statements required to
explain the same process in purely individual-level terms. As a result,
even if the group-level explanation retains reference to
individual-level cognitive properties and non-cognitive structures,
there will be opportunities to substantially reduce the number of
statements used in the explanation and there is a possibility that the
group-level explanation will be shorter and more elegant.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Individual-level explanations of intelligent behaviour are not always
simpler than group-level explanations. This is not to say that
particular individual-level explanations are not superior to group-level
explanations. Nor is it to rule out an argument that individual-level
explanation is better based on another, non-simplicity-based, metric.
Nor is it to rule out a general non-explanatory-value-based argument
against group minds. Our aim has only been to show that appeal to
explanatory simplicity is not enough to show that group-level
explanation is inferior to individual-level explanation.</p>
