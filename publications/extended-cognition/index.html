<h1 class="unnumbered" id="article-summary">Article Summary</h1>
<p>Extended cognition takes the idea that your mind is ‘on’ your
smartphone literally. It says that human cognitive states and processes
sometimes spill outside our heads and into objects in our environment.
Alleged examples include not just smartphones, but also use of simpler
technology (pencil and paper to perform a calculation), our own body
(ticking off our fingers when we count), and other people (our spouse
who remembers appointments so we don’t have to).</p>
<p>There are three main arguments for extended cognition.</p>
<p><em>Functionalist</em> arguments rely on similarities in functional
structure between extended processes and (actual or possible) internal
cognitive processes. Cognition extends because the physical mechanisms
that support it ‘work the same way’ in both cases. <em>Inference to the
best explanation</em> arguments canvas the benefits that extended
cognition would bring to psychology. We should believe that cognition
extends because it would make our psychological theories more unified,
elegant, and fruitful. <em>Second-wave</em> arguments emphasise the ways
in which our brains integrate with our environment. Cognition extends
because brains, bodies, and environment are so tightly intertwined that,
when we solve certain cognitive tasks, they count as a single
system.</p>
<p>Extended cognition is attacked on many fronts. It has been claimed
that it generates <em>absurdly high levels of extension</em> (‘cognitive
bloat’); that it is inferior to the more conservative hypothesis of
<em>embedded cognition</em>; that its arguments confuse <em>causal
coupling with constitution</em>; and that its alleged cases fail to
satisfy some proposed <em>mark of the cognitive</em>.</p>
<p>Extended cognition concerns only the cognitive,
information-processing aspects of mental life. It has, however, inspired
similar claims about extension for other aspects of the mind, including
conscious experience, emotions, moods, intentional agency, knowledge,
and the self.</p>
<p>Extended cognition is part of a wider ‘4E cognition’ research
programme. The four Es stand for extended, embedded, embodied, and
enactive cognition. Each E offers a closely related, albeit distinct
perspective on the role of the environment in cognition. Other forms of
externalism about the mind – <a

cognition</a> – are less closely related to extended cognition.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="extended-cognition"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Extended cognition</h1>
<p>Humans love their devices. Smartphones, tablets, computers, paper
notebooks, calendars, and to-do lists play a pervasive role in our
lives. These pieces of technology cause us to think and to behave in
certain ways, and we in turn modify them to influence our future thought
and behaviour. Often we don’t appreciate how much we rely on them until
they’re gone. Empirical work in psychology suggests that this dependence
runs very deep. Even during relatively undemanding tasks – e.g. copying
a simple coloured pattern made of puzzle pieces – we off-load
information processing onto the environment to reduce work for our
brains <span class="citation" data-cites="BallardHayhoe97">(Ballard et
al. 1997)</span>. Once one recognises this, one sees it everywhere: a
bartender lines up cocktail glasses of different shapes to remember a
complex order; a mathematician uses pencil and paper to guide their
steps in a calculation; a child uses their fingers to count off the days
until their next birthday. These observations reveal that intelligent,
adaptive human thought and behaviour need not always be produced by the
brain alone. It often involves a two-way interaction between the brain,
body, and world <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dennett96 Hutchins95 Simon69">(Dennett 1996; Hutchins 1995;
Simon 1969)</span>.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) goes beyond this
relatively uncontroversial observation in a controversial way.
Environmental processes don’t merely interact with our brain to produce
thought and behaviour. Those environmental processes <em>have as much
claim to be mental or cognitive</em> as their brain-based collaborators.
Human cognition literally extends into smartphones, tablets, notebooks,
to-do lists, and cocktail glasses.</p>
<dl>
<dt>HEC</dt>
<dd>
Some actual human cognitive states/processes extend outside our brains
to include, as parts, states/processes in the environment.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>HEC is frequently misunderstood, so it is worth taking care here.</p>
<p>HEC applies the slightly puzzling concept of ‘extension’ to cognitive
processes. It is important to realise that HEC is not a claim about
cognition considered in some abstract non-physical sense, or about
cognition considered from a first-person phenomenological point of view.
It is a claim about cognition’s physical, mechanistic basis. That
physical basis has a location and an extent. Traditional wisdom has it
that the physical basis of human cognition (its ‘realiser’ in
functionalist terms) is located exclusively inside the human brain. HEC
says that this is false: a mixture of brain and environmental
states/processes underlie (realise) cognition.</p>
<p>What counts as the ‘environment’ may not always be precisely defined.
For our purposes, the environment is anything outside the brain or
central nervous system. Thus, your cognitive processes might extend into
external technology (smartphones, notebooks), your non-neural body
(fingers, limbs, tendons), naturally occurring objects around you
(useful sticks and stones), tokens of public language (appropriate sound
waves and ink marks), or the brains of other people (your spouse).</p>
<p>There are several claims that are often mistakenly associated with
HEC.</p>
<p>HEC does not say that the environment is as important as the brain
for cognition. The brain may remain the principal player behind our
thought and behaviour. What HEC says is that the brain is not the
<em>only</em> player: it is not the sole locus of human cognition <span
class="citation" data-cites="Clark07">(see Clark 2007a on
‘organism-centered’ cognition)</span>. HEC does not say how much of
cognition extends. It is compatible with some, even most, of our
cognitive life being wholly internal and brain-based. Only some
instances of human cognition need extend for HEC to be true. HEC is also
silent about whether extended cognition is a good thing for the agent in
question. Sometimes it is (e.g. when a smartphone increases your memory
capacity or improves your calculating ability), but sometimes it isn’t
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Sprevak12a BorsboomCramer18">(Borsboom et al. 2018;
e.g. when a smartphone sustains unhealthy cognitive biases or
pathological worries about your self image, see Sprevak 2011)</span>.
HEC similarly says nothing about whether extended cognition is the
outcome of a voluntary choice by the agent (or anyone else). We may be
drawn into entanglements with the environment without our awareness or
consent. Finally, HEC does not say anything about whether external
objects have an independent mental life of their own. As far as HEC is
concerned, a smartphone sitting by itself need have no more mental life
than an isolated neuron sitting inside a Petri dish. It is only when a
smartphone (or a neuron) stands in the right relationship to the rest of
our brain that it becomes part of our cognitive life and endowed with
mental/cognitive properties.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="arguments-for-extended-cognition"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Arguments for extended
cognition</h1>
<p>There are three main arguments for the hypothesis of extended
cognition (HEC). All of them appear in Clark and Chalmers’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="ClarkChalmers98">(1998)</span> classic
paper and each can be illustrated using their thought experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inga has normal human memory. One day, she hears of an interesting
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Inga thinks, recalls that
MoMA is on 53rd Street, and sets off. Otto suffers from a mild form of
Alzheimer’s disease and he always writes down useful information in his
notebook. On the same day, Otto also hears of the exhibition at MoMA,
retrieves the address from his notebook, and sets off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clark and Chalmers say that Otto has a belief that MoMA is on 53rd
Street. This belief – and Otto’s cognitive processes associated with
storing and recalling it – extends outside Otto’s brain and into his
notebook. Before proceeding to the arguments, it is worth noting that
this is not meant to be a realistic description of Alzheimer’s disease
or any actual real-life case. Clark and Chalmers are describing an
idealised set of interactions with the environment that they say
<em>would</em> give rise to extended cognition. They claim that more
complex versions of these interactions occur in common real-life cases
(e.g. smartphone use) and similar arguments could be given for these
more complex cases to those given for Otto and Inga below.</p>
<p><em>Functionalist arguments.</em> The claim here is that Otto and
Inga are identical in a way that matters to functionalism. <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/functionalism">Functionalism</a>
is a philosophical theory that says that the functional role of a
physical state/process determines whether that state/process is
mental/cognitive. Functionalism about beliefs says that what makes a
brain state a belief is that it functions in a way appropriate to a
belief. Clark and Chalmers observe that Otto’s notebook functions for
him in roughly the same way as Inga’s biological memory functions for
her. The state of Otto’s notebook interacts with his desires and other
beliefs in a manner similar to that in which the state of Inga’s
biological memory interacts with her desires and other beliefs. Exposure
to new information causes Otto to modify the state of his notebook.
Exposure to new information causes Inga to modify the state of her
biological memory. Otto’s notebook causes him to stop at 53rd Street.
Inga’s biological memory causes her to stop at 53rd Street. The
‘coarse-grained’ functional role of the stored information appears to be
the same in both cases. Clark and Chalmers conclude that just as Inga
has a belief that MoMA is on 53rd Street, so Otto has a belief (partly
realised in his notebook) with the same content.</p>
<p>This argument relies on accepting functionalism about beliefs, and
also on the ‘parity principle’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a
process which, <em>were it done in the head</em>, we would have no
hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that
part of the world <em>is</em> (so we claim) part of the cognitive
process. <span class="citation" data-cites="ClarkChalmers98">(Clark
&amp; Chalmers 1998 p. 8, emphasis in original)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parity principle says that we should not be prejudiced against
treating Otto’s notebook as a realiser of one of his cognitive states
merely because it is outside his head. Recent versions of the
functionalist argument for HEC use the parity principle to block an
objection to the original functionalist argument: Otto’s notebook and
Inga’s biological memory are not <em>exactly</em> alike in their
functional roles. This flaw was pressed by early critics of HEC <span
class="citation" data-cites="AizawaAdams01 Rupert04">(Adams &amp; Aizawa
2001; Rupert 2004)</span> and cited as a reason to think that Otto’s
notebook and Inga’s biological memory don’t have the same claim to
mental status. However, although Otto and Inga are not exactly
functionally alike, Otto <em>is</em> functionally identical to a
hypothetical intelligent being who uses a notebook inside its head to
store information (e.g. an extraterrestrial who uses internal ink-marks
to encode some of its memories). If it is <em>possible</em> for an
intelligent being to have a fully cognitive internal memory system like
Otto’s notebook, and we accept the parity principle and functionalism,
then we should say that Otto’s <em>actual</em> notebook counts as a case
of extended cognition. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sprevak08b">(For a discussion of this argument, see Sprevak
2009.)</span></p>
<p><em>Inference to the best explanation.</em> The idea here is that HEC
affords some <em>explanatory advantage</em> to psychology. The argument
takes the form of an <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/inference-to-the-best-explanation">inference
to the best explanation (IBE)</a>: we should believe that HEC is true
because of the explanatory benefits its acceptance would bring to
psychology. Clark and Chalmers say that HEC would unify otherwise
unrelated patterns of human thought and behaviour. Otto’s and Inga’s
cases illustrate this point. Inga arrived at 53rd Street because she
<em>wanted</em> to go to MoMA and <em>believed</em> that it was there.
Assuming HEC is true, Otto arrived at 53rd Street because he
<em>wanted</em> to go to MoMA and <em>believed</em> that it was there.
HEC allows us to explain both agents as falling under the same
belief–desire psychology, irrespective of whether they use internal or
external resources for their information storage. Always explaining
Otto’s behaviour differently from that of Inga, and in terms of Otto’s
internal beliefs <em>about</em> his notebook, seems to introduce
needless complexity. The notebook is a constant in Otto’s life, similar
to Inga’s biological memory. At least for certain explanatory purposes,
it seems redundant to always point to the notebook when explaining
Otto’s behaviour. Accepting HEC arguably makes the notion of belief in
psychology ‘deeper and more unified, and … more useful in explanation’

<p><em>Second-wave arguments.</em> These arguments tend to downplay the
considerations behind the functionalist and IBE arguments and instead
emphasise ‘complementarity’. What is meant by this is that external
states and processes need not be similar – either functionally or in
terms of their role in psychological explanation – to any internal ones.
What justifies HEC is a tight, reciprocal <em>integration</em> between
brains, bodies, and the environment. This approach has affinities with
dynamical systems theory, which models the brain, body, and environment
as a single system whose elements cannot be prised apart when solving a
cognitive task <span class="citation" data-cites="ThelenSmith94">(Thelen
&amp; Smith 1994)</span>. In their original paper, Clark and Chalmers
call this position ‘active externalism’: all parts (internal and
external) are ‘active’ in the sense that they work together in a
non-redundant fashion to solve a cognitive task. The resulting
interaction need not be similar to any (actual or possible) internal
cognitive process, and there is no reason why it should be treated as
such in psychological explanation. Otto’s notebook isn’t cognitive
because it is functionally like Inga’s memory, or because it is
explanatorily beneficial for psychologists to group them together.
Otto’s notebook is cognitive because it is systematically, reciprocally,
and inextricably integrated with his brain during certain cognitive
tasks. This integration is intended, at least in certain cases, to have
a normative dimension: it arises from, and it is maintained by, social
practices, norms, and institutions. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Menary10a Sutton10">(For a reconstruction of second-wave
arguments, see Menary 2010a; Sutton 2010.)</span> (Note that talk of a
‘second wave’ may suggest that the ‘first wave’ was a failure, but it is
by no means clear that either the functionalist or IBE argument cannot
be made to work, or that all three arguments for HEC cannot be combined
into a unified package.)</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="objections-to-extended-cognition"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Objections to extended
cognition</h1>
<p>The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) has, unsurprisingly,
encountered considerable resistance. Here are four common
objections.</p>
<p><em>Cognitive bloat</em>. Fans of HEC say that human cognition
extends in certain cases and to a certain degree, but they usually want
to avoid claiming <em>too much</em> cognitive extension. Too much
extension might make our existing mental concepts pointless, absurd, or
otherwise unfit for purpose. We might end up saying you believe
everything on the Internet or that you and I believe the same things
just because we happen to live in the same environment. This is called
the problem of ‘cognitive bloat’. Avoiding cognitive bloat requires
drawing some principled line between those relationships with the
environment (functional/explanatory/integrational) that entail cognitive
extension and those that do not. Drawing such a line has not proved
easy. Consider that not only your smartphone, but also your office
computer, local library, friends, co-workers, and in many cases the
whole Internet contain information on which you routinely draw to guide
your behaviour in a way not dissimilar to that in which Otto relies on
his notebook. Consider too that when you and I live in the same
environment, we often draw on the same set of environmental resources to
guide our respective behaviours. An argument for HEC needs to guard
against becoming a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the view.
Introducing restrictions to avoid cognitive bloat, however, may cut
against the assumptions required to motivate any form of HEC at all –
for example, they may violate the parity principle <span
class="citation" data-cites="Sprevak08b">(see Sprevak 2009)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Embedded cognition</em>. The hypothesis of embedded cognition
(HEMC) is an alternative to HEC that claims to offer all of the latter’s
explanatory benefits but without the ‘cost’ of saying that notebooks
have mental/cognitive properties. HEMC and HEC agree on almost all
points: extended processes are functionally similar to internal
cognitive processes; grouping extended and internal processes together
is sometimes useful in psychological explanation; brains are integrated
with the environment when we solve certain cognitive problems. HEMC and
HEC differ in that HEC says that extended cognitive processes are 100%
mental/cognitive whereas HEMC says that only the internal, brain-based
parts of those processes are mental/cognitive. According to HEMC,
extended processes are composed of separate mental and non-mental parts
– and the mental parts reside exclusively inside the head. According to
HEC, extended processes have a uniformly mental/cognitive nature inside
and out. Critics of HEC argue that we should abandon HEC for HEMC
because the latter provides the explanatory benefits of the former but
it is more ontologically parsimonious (it attributes fewer
mental/cognitive properties to the world) and it is more conservative
(it fits better with traditional internalist psychology) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Rupert04 Sprevak09">(see Rupert 2004;
Sprevak 2010)</span>.</p>
<p><em>The coupling/constitution fallacy</em>. Arguments for extended
cognition often describe a two-way causal coupling between our brains
and the environment. One might be tempted to say that cognition extends
<em>because</em> of this coupling relationship. However, just because X
and Y are causally coupled does not mean that X is part of Y. The
expansion of a bimetallic strip in a thermostat is coupled to the motion
of atoms in the surrounding air in the room, but that does not mean that
the strip’s expansion is a process that extends into the atoms of the
air <span class="citation" data-cites="AdamsAizawa07">(Adams &amp;
Aizawa 2007 p. 91)</span>. Similarly, your brain and the environment may
be causally coupled but that does not mean that your brain processes
extend into the environment. This objection appears to most directly
threaten second-wave arguments for extended cognition, since those
arguments emphasise two-way causal coupling between the brain, body, and
environment. An advocate of HEC needs to find something beyond mere
coupling that justifies cognitive extension. A natural resort would be
to appeal to either the <em>explanatory value</em> of treating the
coupled system as cognitive or the <em>functional similarity</em>
between the coupled system and an internal (actual or possible) case of
cognition. However, this would collapse second-wave arguments into their
first-wave versions <span class="citation"
data-cites="AizawaAdams01 AdamsAizawa07">(see Adams &amp; Aizawa 2001,
2007)</span>. Alternatively, a second-wave defender of HEC might stress
the normative nature of the coupling relationship and explore how this
might render the relationship constitutive rather than merely
causal.</p>
<p><em>The mark of the cognitive</em>. A ‘mark of the cognitive’ is a
set of necessary or sufficient conditions for a physical state/process
to be cognitive. A mark of the cognitive is often sought as a way of
overcoming disagreements between philosophers about HEC. If one could
agree on a mark of the cognitive, one could use it to decide whether
disputed cases (like Otto’s notebook) really are cases of extended
cognition. Proposed marks of the cognitive tend, however, to be at least
as controversial as the cases they are supposed to help decide. Various
marks of the cognitive have been proposed, including: (i) a cognitive
process must involve non-derived representational content and be
functionally similar to actual cases of internal, brain-based human
cognition <span class="citation" data-cites="AdamsAizawa07">(Adams &amp;
Aizawa 2007)</span>; (ii) a cognitive process must be part of an
integrated, persisting system, and it must causally contribute to a wide
range of cognitive phenomena <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rupert09a">(Rupert 2009)</span>; (iii) a process is
cognitive so long as it ‘belongs’ to a subject in the sense of causally
contributing to the intentional content of that subject’s personal-level
states <span class="citation" data-cites="Rowlands10">(Rowlands
2010)</span>. Critics of HEC tend to favour conservative marks of the
cognitive like (i) or (ii), which rule out many cases of extended
cognition. Advocates of HEC tend to favour liberal marks of the
cognitive like (iii), which allow in many cases of extended cognition.
There is currently no consensus about which is the correct mark of the
cognitive, and one may worry that no such set of necessary or sufficient
conditions exists. Just as there seems to be no single set of necessary
or sufficient conditions that determines which physical processes are
<em>healthy</em>, <em>living</em>, or <em>cancerous</em>, so there might
be no set of necessary or sufficient conditions that determines which
physical processes are <em>cognitive</em> or <em>mental</em> <span

<h1 data-number="4" id="extended-cognitions-kindred-views"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Extended cognition’s kindred
views</h1>
<p>Philosophical work on the hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) has
focused not only on arguments for, and objections against, the view, but
also on tracing HEC’s connections to other claims about the mind. Two
types of kindred view stand out: claims about <em>other aspects of the
mind extending</em> and <em>other forms of philosophical externalism
about cognition</em>.</p>
<p><em>Other aspects of the mind extending.</em> Clark and Chalmers
<span class="citation" data-cites="ClarkChalmers98">(1998)</span>
restricted their claim about extension to the cognitive,
information-processing aspects of the mind (e.g. storage and retrieval
of dispositional beliefs). They flagged up conscious experience as an
aspect of the mind that is likely to escape their arguments; conscious
experience could be entirely brain-based. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Noe04">Noë (2004)</span> disagrees. Using variants of the
IBE and second-wave arguments of §2, Noë argues that the physical
mechanisms of consciousness extend outside the brain and into the body
and environment. <span class="citation" data-cites="Clark08b">Clark
(2009)</span> replies that while such extensions are theoretically
possible, they are unlikely to happen because our brain’s causal
interface with the world (our eyes and our hands) has a narrow bandwidth
which (information-rich) conscious experience cannot cross.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not the only source of novel claims about mental
extension. <span class="citation" data-cites="CarterGordon16">Carter et
al. (2016)</span> say that emotions extend when the physical processes
involved in their <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/emotions-nature-of/sections/emotions-and-their-contents-intentionality">cognitive-appraisal</a>
component extend. <span class="citation"
data-cites="ColombettiRoberts15">Colombetti &amp; Roberts (2015)</span>
argue that all kinds of affective mental states (emotions, moods,
sentiments, and temperaments) extend when external objects are used to
regulate them. <span class="citation" data-cites="Vierkant14">Vierkant
(2014)</span> argues that intentional agency and <a

data-cites="CarterKallestrup16">Carter &amp; Kallestrup (2016)</span>
explore extension claims for epistemic states like <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/metaphysics-of-knowledge/sections/the-realization-of-knowledge">knowledge</a>.
<span class="citation" data-cites="Clark07a">Clark (2007b)</span> argues
that the self extends. Essays in <span class="citation"
data-cites="AndersonCairns18">Anderson et al. (2018)</span> explore
extension claims about other aspects of the mind, including processes
that differ significantly from the task-based, problem-solving examples
favoured by Clark and Chalmers (e.g. friendship and imaginative
engagement with a text).</p>
<p><em>Other forms of externalism about cognition.</em> HEC is often
described as part of a wider research programme called ‘4E cognition’.
The other Es are <em>embedded</em>, <em>embodied</em>, and
<em>enactive</em> cognition. We have already met <em>embedded</em>
cognition with the hypothesis of embedded cognition (see §3). <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/embodied-cognition"><em>Embodied</em>
cognition</a> says that cognition depends in some way on the physical
nature of our bodies. Different versions of embodied cognition cash this
claim out differently. In some versions, embodied cognition simply
expresses a body-based version of HEC: cognition depends on our body
when our physical bodies partly realise our cognitive processes
(e.g. when a child counts on her fingers, her mathematical cognising
extends into the physical movement of her fingers). However, embodied
cognition may also be used to express other forms of externalism about
the mind. <span class="citation" data-cites="LakoffJohnson99">Lakoff
&amp; Johnson (1999)</span> say that the specific shape of the human
body influences the semantic content of our concepts, including abstract
logical and mathematical concepts. This is something about which HEC is
largely silent. <em>Enactive</em> cognition says that cognition consists
in a looping interaction between perception and action that involves
brain, body, and world. This has obvious affinity with second-wave
arguments for HEC (see §2), but specific versions of enactivism might
differ in various ways from HEC about how they see this integration
working. Some enactivists reject HEC’s framing in terms of
representations and information processing: ‘sensorimotor’ enactivists
say that cognition consists in implicit, non-representational bodily
skills <span class="citation" data-cites="Noe04">(Noë 2004)</span>;
‘autopoietic’ enactivists say that cognition consists in biologically
inspired relationships, such as autopoiesis, adaptivity, and
sense-making <span class="citation" data-cites="DiPaolo05">(Di Paolo
2005)</span>.</p>
<p>HEC has a more distant relationship to other kinds of philosophical
externalism, such as content externalism, direct realism about
perception, collective intentionality, and group cognition. <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/content-wide-and-narrow/sections/content-externalism-vs-extended-cognition">Content
externalism</a> says that the representational content of our cognitive
states does not supervene on the internal physical state of our brains.
HEC has almost nothing to say about this. HEC’s claim is about the
location of the physical vehicles of cognition, not about the factors
that determine their representational content <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hurley09">(Hurley 2010)</span>. <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/perception/sections/naive-realism-and-disjunctive-theories-of-appearance">Direct
realism about perception</a> says that perception involves a perceiver
standing in a special ‘perceiving’ relation to a real external object
beyond her brain. HEC assumes almost nothing about whether this view is
correct. Indeed, HEC is frequently stated in intentionalist (as opposed
to direct-realist) terms. <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/collective-intentionality">Collective
intentionality</a> is the claim that groups of individuals sometimes
have shared mental states, such as belief, knowledge, and intention.
Closely related to this is the notion of <a
href="https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/collective-intentionality/sections/group-cognition">group
cognition</a>: a cognitive state or process that is properly attributed
to a group of individuals rather than to the individuals that compose
that group. While both of these last views agree with HEC that cognition
is not found exclusively inside individual heads, HEC is a claim about
individual human cognition extending, not about shared or group
cognition.</p>
<p>HEC may be combined with a variety of other externalist claims about
the mind, but it makes a separate, unique claim about how the human mind
spreads out into world.</p>
