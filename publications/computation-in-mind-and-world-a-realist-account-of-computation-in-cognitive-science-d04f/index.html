                                <p>This Ph.D.&#xA0;thesis concerns the truthmakers of the computational
theory of mind (CTM). The CTM is the view that some, or all, of our
cognitive processes are computations. A potential problem with the CTM
is that it is not clear what it means for a system, such as the human
brain, to perform a computation. This problem is often glossed over in
the literature &#x2013; computation is assumed to be just like what electronic
computers do. Unfortunately, what electronic computers do is far from
clear. My thesis addresses this concern. Specifically, it answers the
question: under what conditions does a real-world system, such as a
human brain or electronic computer, perform one computation rather than
another? Searle (1992), Putnam (1988), and Kripke (1982) have argued
that the only possible answers to this question are anti-realist. On
their view, the computation that a system performs is a function of how
human agents interpret that system, rather than of the mind-independent
world. If this were true, then the consequences for cognitive science
would be dire. Cognitive science would not explain cognition, it would
presuppose cognition. In my thesis, I defend cognitive science from
these anti-realist attacks. I argue that mind-independent facts can
determine the computation that a system performs. My argument consists
of two parts. First, I develop a semantics for computation talk in the
context of cognitive science. This provides an account of the semantic
content of our computational claims in that context. Then, I present an
account of the metaphysical facts that make that semantic content true
or false. I argue that these metaphysical facts are, at least possibly,
mind-independent. The resulting notion of computation is compared to the
alternatives of Chalmers (1996), Copeland (1996), and Mellor (1991).</p>
